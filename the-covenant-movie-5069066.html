The two stars also posed for some adorable photos together on Jake’s Instagram on Apr. 2, to promote the film. “Dude arrived in Hollywood yesterday and already has a palm tree growing out of his head. @darsalim1,” he captioned the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>carousel of photos</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9OhnGabn6uyr63NrWSmp6aesm6Bj29waW5mZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sarah-beeny-the-one-show-reveals-fear-of-death.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sarah Beeny makes emotional comeback to TV as she reveals she's been living with a 'fear of death' d</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kim-kardashian-west-christmas-outfit-2020.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kim Kardashian West Wore a Six-Pack Schiaparelli Leather Outfit for Christmas 2020</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
