The twosome split in 2017 and Olindo moved on with Shah in 2018.</p><p>“Babies like him better than me. Kids like him better than me. Adults like him better than me. My own family likes him better than me,” she captioned a since-deleted Instagram photo with Shah in 2019.</p><p>Later that year, <a href=#>he made his debut on Southern Charm</a> after a lot of convincing from Olindo.</p><p>“He wanted nothing to do with it. But he did it for me which is really nice. I know he didn’t want to. But he handled it like a champ,” she told <a href=#>Decider</a> in May 2019 before gushing about him. “He makes me want to do better. He’s an amazing dancer, I have probably hundreds of videos of him dancing. Metul, he’s really helped me [see] I don’t need to go out all the time and people also shouldn’t be pressuring you to do it. I definitely go out less and am home a lot more but I’m so much happier that way.”</p><p>As the pair celebrated three years of dating in 2020, news broke that Olindo wasn’t returning for season 7 of Southern Charm. She and Shah subsequently left South Carolina and moved to New York City for his job.</p><p>“Charleston farewell tour begins,” he wrote alongside a photo with Olindo on May 3, 2021.</p><p>Two months later, the fashion designer admitted that she was having a hard time adjusting.</p><p>“I want to start a small/discussion group in New York for girls struggling to meet friends. I’m thankful to have some friends here already but I cannot imagine moving to a new city and knowing NO ONE,” Olindo wrote via Instagram in July 2021. “Making friends as adults is hard and I want to help women feel less alone. Would you come?? Omg what if no one came and it was just me that showed up???? Spiraling.”</p><p>That same month, speculation surfaced that the pair split after he was caught cheating. Olindo’s agent confirmed on July 12, 2021, <a href=#>that the twosome are “no longer together” as she is “back in Charleston and plans to stay there for the time being.</a>” Olindo seemingly confirmed the cheating accusations — which Shah has yet to publicly comment on — <a href=#>via a teary Instagram selfie.</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Nothing will be worse than losing my dad but this is a close second,” she wrote. “Betrayal is never easy for anyone and I’m just so sorry to anyone else that has stumbled across those terrible messages.”</p><p>Scroll through for a timeline of Olindo and Shah’s relationship:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwLDB06Gcq6ZdmLWivsysZKeZn6K2pnnOpaCnnJ9iuqbA1KVkrKCRncBuvsSlmK2hn6PAqbXPZquipZWhtq%2Bxjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./aldi-dupes-dyson-hairdryer-super-sonic.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Aldi shoppers are going mad for a Dyson dupe thats super quick at drying your hair - and its u</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./taryn-manning-orange-is-the-new-black-star-arrested-for-threaten.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Orange is the New Black Star Arrested For Threatening to KILL Her Best Friend!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
