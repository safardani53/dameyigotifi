"Yeah, it was a shock," Janney said of the show announcing its end. "I have my own theories, but I've been told not to express them. But listen, eight years is a great long run for a show."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">CBS announced in February that the show was canceled after premiering in 2013, and Janney <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>ventured to guess</a> that the reason was "probably money"-related.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Getting to be part of Mom these past 8 years...showing the laughter, love and hope that can come with recovery, has been one of the great honors of my life," she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>reacted to the news</a> on Instagram at the time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Janney's onscreen daughter Anna Faris <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>departed the show</a> in September, just before the first day of production on season 8.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Janney stars as a recovering alcoholic who reconnects with her estranged grown daughter Christy (Faris), who's overcoming her own struggles with addiction. They find community in a group of women from their Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, played by Jaime Pressly, Kristen Johnston, Mimi Kennedy and Beth Hall.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"You know, it's one thing to be part of a show that entertains, which in and of itself is a wonderful thing," Janney told CBS Sunday Morning. "But to also have an impact on people who are in recovery, or people who have loved ones or family members who are going through it, to make recovery a more approachable option."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It particularly resonated for her, after she lost her brother Hal Janney to addiction 10 years ago. "I just – I just miss his sense of humor, really," she said, revealing she still calls him.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>RELATED VIDEO: Allison Janney on 'Pinching' Herself Working With Breaking News in Yuba County's All-Star Cast</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My favorite time to talk to him was when I was in the car driving someplace, so I always think of him when I'm in the car," Janney explained. "And I still have his phone number, and I dial it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The final episode of Mom <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>airs this Thursday on CBS</a>, but Janney isn't quite ready to bid farewell. "I hate change," she said. "It makes me … I get afraid – I always have – to let something go and not know what's next. I think the biggest thing I need to learn how to say is no."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Want to get the biggest stories from PEOPLE every weekday? </strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1><strong>Subscribe to our new podcast</strong></a><strong>, PEOPLE Every Day, to get the essential celebrity, entertainment and human interest news stories Monday through Friday.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Oscar winner also revealed that she's worn a wig to play her character for the past eight years, now rocking a short natural grey 'do. "It was pretty funny, though, when I came to show up for our first Mom episode in October when we started in 2020," Janney recalled.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"And the producers were like, 'What have you done? Bonnie can't – how are we gonna explain this?'" she recounted. "I'm like, 'You guys, I've been wearing a wig since season 1!' None of them knew that I had been wearing a wig. So, you know, now all of America knows that I was wearing a wig!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The I, Tonya actress revealed she was going for "a Helen Mirren thing" <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>with the new look</a>, when she appeared on PEOPLE TV's One Last Thing in February. "It started out with just COVID choices, you know," she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was in Ohio for five months of the pandemic," Janney explained. "My natural color started growing in — which is gray. And then I thought, you know, I've always wanted to cut it off and do a Helen Mirren thing. I just wanted to try it ... I just get very brave with my hair."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The series finale of Mom airs May 13 on CBS.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6SrfKK4y6KqqKZdn66vusSyZKannWK0psDToqWgZZOWu6Sxy56bZpmWqbKzeZdmqp6Zo6S7tHnWmqpmmV2otbCvymg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sedat-peker.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sedat Peker- Age, Height, Net Worth, Wife, Career, Nationality</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mike-william-gesicki-s7rw-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mike William Gesicki (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
