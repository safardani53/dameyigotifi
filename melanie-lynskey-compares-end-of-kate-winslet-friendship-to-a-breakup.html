It’s just <a href=#>she became a gigantic, international movie star</a> and she didn’t have a lot of time and then, suddenly, she’d be in Los Angeles and not have time.”</p><p class=p1>Lynskey and the&nbsp;<i>Titanic&nbsp;</i>star, 47, met on the set of&nbsp;<i>Heavenly Creatures,&nbsp;</i>which was filmed in the&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Sweet Home Alabama</a>&nbsp;</i>actress’ native New Zealand. The movie, directed by<a href=#><strong> Peter Jackson</strong></a>, follows Winslet’s Juliet after she moves with her family from England to Christchurch, New Zealand. The teenager <a href=#>quickly sparks a friendship</a> with Lynskey’s Pauline. Juliet and Pauline’s passionate bond ultimately leads to murder.</p><p class=p1>While the movie marked breakout roles for both Winslet and Lynskey,&nbsp;<i>Heavenly Creatures,&nbsp;</i>which even earned an <a href=#>Oscar nomination</a> for Best Original Screenplay, soon catapulted Winslet to widespread fame. As she went off to film her next blockbuster hits while Lynskey stayed in New Zealand, they<a href=#> “gradually” lost touch</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Melanie-Lynskey-Kate-Winslet-Losing-Touch.jpg><p class=p1>“It happens in relationships. People kind of drift apart, but that was so painful for me,” the&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Last of Us</a>&nbsp;</i>star confessed to host <strong>Josh Horowitz</strong>, noting she has also had similar experiences with other costars. “I did this movie with this actor and when we were finished I said, ‘Oh my gosh, I’m just so happy that I met you and <a href=#>we have this friendship</a>,’ and she said, ‘Yeah, I’m not friends with actors. I don’t stay friends with actors.’ And I was just like, ‘What?’ I was so shocked by it.”</p><p class=p1>Lynskey added: “I was so sensitive. I was always so injured by losing these great loves I was having. You know, It got easier.”</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>Ever After</i>&nbsp;actress — who <a href=#>shares a 4-year-old daughter</a> with her husband,<a href=#><strong> Jason Ritter</strong> </a>— last saw Winslet at the 2009 premiere of&nbsp;<i>Away We Go</i>, <a href=#>calling it “so fun” to reunite</a> for the first time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Melanie-Lynskey-Discusses-Losing-Touch-With-Heavenly-Creatures-Costar-Kate-Winslet.jpg><p class=p1>“She was a huge inspiration for me [after I watched] the way she was handling all that as young as she was,” the&nbsp;<i>Togetherness&nbsp;</i>alum said on Thursday, referring to the <a href=#>frequent criticism of the British actress’ body</a> during her early years in Hollywood. “I know she’s a very, very confident person, but everyone’s sensitive and she’s very sensitive. … I remember, at the time, being so furious on her behalf, especially because Kate Winslet is now in the world [and] doing movies, and you’re getting to witness that talent and those performances. This is an actor who comes along once in a generation; just focus on that.”</p><p class=p1>Lynskey continued: “It infuriated me so much and I just was always amazed by how gracefully she handled all of that. It was always really impressive.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>The Emmy Award nominee, who is also a<a href=#> fervent body positive advocate</a>, previously revealed that she and Winslet had a “very intense” friendship while filming&nbsp;<i>Heavenly Creatures.</i></p><p class=p1>“It was more intense than some love affairs that I have had in my life.&nbsp;We developed such a bond that for a long time we couldn’t let it go,” Lynskey told&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Time</a>&nbsp;</i>in 2012. “We would write each other letters and talk on the phone all the time. We were in constant contact for so long. Then <a href=#>around the time of&nbsp;</a><i><a href=#>Titanic</a>,</i>&nbsp;her life got crazy because she became a superstar. I was staying with her right after she filmed that and then we totally lost touch at that time. I admire her so much though.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGamnZyWu6qxjKWwp6ubmsZur86mp5qqlah6prrDZqafZZuWwaZ51qKlrKSVqXqnvsiepZ2rmJ69bsDOZphmmqKarqzBz2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./oscars-pre-parties-2023-photos.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Oscars Pre-Parties 2023: Photos Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jon-gosselin-to-make-stripper-debut-at-atlantic-city-nightclub-w473682.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jon Gosselin to Make Stripper Debut at Atlantic City Nightclub</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
