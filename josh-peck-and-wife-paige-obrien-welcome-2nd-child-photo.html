The newborn was joined by older brother Max, who Peck and the cinematographer, 31, <a href=#>welcomed in December 2018</a>.</p><p>O’Brien also <a href=#>shared several photos of baby Shai</a> on her own account, including a sweet black-and-white snapshot of the 3-year-old kissing his sibling on the forehead.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Josh-Peck-Wife-Paige-OBrien-Welcome-2nd-Child-0002.jpg><p>The couple — <a href=#>who tied the knot in June 2017</a> — announced that <a href=#>they were expecting their second child</a> in June, when O’Brien shared a photo of her cradling her belly while on a trip to Puglia, Italy. The How I Met Your Father star jokingly asked, “Is mine or no?” in the comments.</p><p>Since Max’s birth, <a href=#>Peck has frequently gushed about the toddler on social media</a>. “If life is a simulation, kids are certainly the best part,” the Amanda Show alum wrote via Instagram in December 2021, alongside a photo of himself kissing the grinning toddler on his cheek. “Happy 3rd Birthday Maxi, you make your mom and my heart sing.”</p><p>Peck previously opened up about how becoming a father has helped him become more patient. “<a href=#>He’s figuring out his place on this earth too</a>. He’s pushing his limits and trying things. I’ve learned that from my wife, really,” The Wackness actor explained in an August 2021 episode of <a href=#>“The School of Greatness” podcast</a>. “I always imagined that I would puff up on my kid and be like, ‘Here are the rules and I’m gonna teach you how to be a man.’”</p><p>Peck continued: “In reality, it’s about me being nonreactive and giving him gentle guidance about what’s right and what’s not. Obviously, you still have your bottom lines … and my wife leads by example in that way.”</p><p>In <a href=#>his memoir, Happy People Are Annoying</a>, the New York native credits his sobriety with helping him become a better husband and father. <a href=#>Peck got sober in 2008</a> and has continued to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and work with his sponsors in the decade since.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I don’t speak in absolutes because I’ve known too many people whose life got too good too quickly and <a href=#>suddenly a drink didn’t sound that bad anymore</a>,” the former child star wrote, noting that he was approaching his 13th year of sobriety while working on the book. “So, in sticking with the whole one day at a time of it all, I cannot guarantee that I will die sober, but I can guarantee that I will go to sleep tonight without a drink.”</p><p>He concluded, “I’ll tell you that today I still go to meetings regularly, I have a sponsor whom I speak to regularly, and a group of sober people who are my best friends. Everything good in my life is because of sobriety.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGajp6OderGxwqRkmqaUYsSqssRmp5qhl5p6sK7RopynZaeauaS7zJ5ka6aUYrCptcudZKmgn6m8cA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./big-shot-season-3.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Will There Be a 'Big Shot' Season 3?
