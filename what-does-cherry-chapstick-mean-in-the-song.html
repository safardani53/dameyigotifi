"Total Eclipse of the Heart" was about vampires being in love, and "I Shot the Sheriff" was actually about Bob Marley's distaste for his girlfriend's decision to take birth control pills, and the Beatles' "Eleanor Rigby" is about fooling people into thinking they're a good band.</p><p>But what about more recent pop hits that have seemingly overt lyrics, like <a href=#>Katy Perry's</a> "I Kissed a Girl"? What does cherry ChapStick mean in it?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What does cherry ChapStick mean in the song, "I Kissed a Girl"?</h2><p>The 2008 pop track that reached No. 1 on the Billboard music chart has a fairly straightforward premise. Let's read the lyrics and analyze them: This was never the way I planned / Not my intention / I got so brave, drink in hand / Lost my discretion / It's not what I'm used to (used to) / Just wanna try you on / I'm curious for you (for you) / Caught my attention.</p><p>I kissed a girl and I liked it / The taste of her cherry ChapStick / I kissed a girl just to try it / I hope my boyfriend don't mind it / It felt so wrong, it felt so right / Don't mean I'm in love tonight / I kissed a girl and I liked it / I liked it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>On a surface reading, Perry's words are telling us a tale. She's out drinking, presumably with some female friends of hers. We know that she has a boyfriend, so it's assumed that she views herself as predominantly heterosexual, however, a wrench is thrown into her self-perception.</p><p>We can infer that thanks to the drink that's in her hand, an alcoholic one, she is emboldened to venture into a new encounter.</p><p>Our narrator in the song kissed a girl, and she liked it. Liked it so much that she says so three times in the hook.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>that song.. i just found out the meaning of cherry chapstick üèÉ</p>‚Äî Tati ‚ô°‚Äôs YOU || mw klaro now (@ahaha_Tati) <a href=#>July 21, 2021</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">But the reference of "cherry ChapStick" in the song isn't just an innocent reference to lip balm.</h2><p>Maybe it was a cold winter's night and Perry's character in the song had placed cherry-flavored ChapStick on her lips.</p><p>However, according to multiple interpretations on the web, the cherry ChapStick coated lips Perry's referring to aren't those lips.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>No, she's actually insinuating that she enjoyed puckering up and smooching what <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joyscribe</a> refers to as this mystery woman's "lady's coin purse," aka her genitals.</p><p>So how did people come to infer this?</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Well that's because in the popular game Just Dance that featured the song, the "Cherry ChapStick" line was actually bleeped out. Why would the developers censor a phrase as innocuous as lip balm? Is it because they don't want to give any free product placement to the ChapStick brand?</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>But has Katy Perry said anything to support this theory? Why yes, she has. In a 2017 acceptance speech for the National Equality Award at the Human Rights Campaign Gala Dinner she said, "I‚Äôm just a singer-songwriter, honestly. I speak my truths, and I paint my fantasies into these little bite-size pop songs. For instance, I kissed a girl and I liked it. Truth be told, I did more than that."</p><p>She should totally have an endorsement deal with GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare, the owners of ChapStick.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIydpp6rXZi1pr7RsmScoJGlwLW1wqRkpp2Ro3qquoytn55lo6S7qA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-latto-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who has Latto dated? | The US Sun</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pete-davidson-reacts-to-ex-cazzie-davids-relationship-essay.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Pete Davidson Reacts to Ex Cazzie Davids Relationship Essay</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
