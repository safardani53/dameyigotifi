Here's what we know.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/miley-cyrus-l-dolly-parton-615599984.jpg><h2>What do the lyrics to Rainbowland mean?</h2><p>Released as part of <a href=#>Miley Cyrus's</a> sixth studio Album, entitled Younger Now, in 2017, the track is a duet between the Wrecking Ball singer and her godmother, and <a href=#>country music</a> legend, <a href=#>Dolly Parton</a>.</p><p>Miley has stated that it was inspired by her multi-coloured recording studio, but Dolly told <a aria-label="Taste of Country (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Taste of Country</a>: "It's really about if we could love one another a little better or be a little kinder, be a little sweeter, we could live in rainbow land.</p><p>"It's really just about dreaming and hoping that we could all do better. It's a good song for the times right now."</p><p>Miley added in an interview with <a href=#>Ellen DeGeneres</a>: "So it's saying if all of us are so different and we all look so different and different shades of humanity, what a rainbow we could really be and live in that land and celebrate it."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON MILEY CYRUS">READ MORE ON MILEY CYRUS</h2><p>The lyrics seem to back this up, with lines likes "Wouldn’t it be nice to live in paradise. Where we’re free to be exactly who we are" and "Let’s all dig down deep inside. Brush the judgment and fear aside".</p><h2>Has Rainbowland been banned?</h2><p>Rainbowland is not subject to any widespread banning, for example by <a href=#>radio </a>stations.</p><p>However, Heyer Elementary School in <a href=#>Wisconsin</a> has removed the song from their set list following a school board decision.</p><p>One mother at the school said that her daughter told her she was "not allowed" to sing it any more when she went to perform in a school concert.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>The school's superintendent, Jim Sebert, confirmed that the track was banned.</p><h2>Why has Rainbowland been banned?</h2><p>Sebert said that the ban was due to the fact that the song "could be perceived as controversial".</p><p>Parents have alleged that this is because of the rainbow's association with <a href=#>LGBTQ+ rights</a> and activism.</p><p>Leigh Radichel Tracy, who has children enrolled in the school district, told the <a aria-label="LA Times (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LA Times</a>: "The School District of Waukesha has really cracked down on anything LBGTQ.</p><p>"So this song being an ‘issue’ has not in any way come as a surprise.</p><p>"All that Miley and Dolly are saying is that they want to live in a world that is accepting, with no judgment and where people can be who they want to be.</p><p>"It’s so sad that this is seen as a ‘controversial issue’ by the School District of Waukesha. It’s a song about a beautiful place of acceptance."</p><p>The school has not confirmed the reason for the ban officially.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvZ2iBdH6RaKmaoZ6XvLi4wKebZqSpp7akv4ymnJqmXay1unnMoqOesV2YxrPB0maZmqaemrFw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-el-chacal-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is El Chacal Dating Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./marsha-hunt-19171017-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Marsha Hunt (Movie Actress) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
