Though hailing from two very different states in the US, they met in California. They met for the first time around the end of 2015 in Los Angeles. Both of them were working on their careers out of LA at that point. And since then, they have been inseparable.&nbsp;</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-909 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Alissa called Neels her BFF in an interview.</h2><p>In an interview on March 2016<span>&nbsp;on the red carpet at the " held at The Beverly Hilton Hotel in Los Angeles, California, Alissa and Neels shared a candid chat.</span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p></p><p>In all of their public appearances and public photo sharing, both Neels and Alissa seem very comfortable with each other.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-910 data-method=placement-service></span><p>But both of them have openly denied having an affair with each other. And they did not even show a bit of acceptance of the possibility that they could be dating in the near future. Neels denied Alissa was his girlfriend. But it is still not clear if they had ever been in a relationship. They could have had a breakup and they could have just slyly dodged the question by cunningly talking of only the present status.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>However, fans of Alissa and Neels ship this pairing a bit too much. An Instagram page has been created in which fans post&nbsp;the duo's moments together. The following Instagram post shows Alissa trying to get a hold of Neels hand and Neel jerking his hand away.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>So, does this mean Alissa&nbsp;is the one pursuing and Neels' the one trying to avoid?</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-911 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2><u>Both Alissa and Neels have big dreams.</u></h2><p>Visser plans to be a success in the music industry.
