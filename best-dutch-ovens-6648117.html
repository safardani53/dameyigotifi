During our jambalaya preparation test, this Dutch oven earned high scores. We noted that browning developed very well, and there was no sticking at all. We also prepared rice in the Dutch oven and found that the rice cooked brilliantly. There was no burning — just a nice, beautiful, even cook.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Oven mitts fit comfortably and securely under the handles of this Dutch oven, which also performed well in our durability test. After hitting it multiple times with a metal spoon, there was only a very slight chip on the lid coating. This piece proved to be both strong and sturdy.&nbsp;Another plus? This beautiful, durable product is also dishwasher-safe.</p><p>After putting this Dutch oven through its paces, we think it's a winner for stewing, browning, and roasting.

And her Enamel Dutch Oven did well in our testing. We found that it was not only aesthetically pleasing, but it was enjoyable to use. The open oval handles were a nice touch when taking it in and out of the oven — even with oven mitts, it felt very secure, which is nice when dealing with a heavy item such as this.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Heat distribution was nice and even, given this Dutch oven’s oval shape, and the chicken browned evenly, resulting in a golden hue. Although the coating is non-stick, we noticed a fond (when little bits of food stick to the surface) and recommend using a bit more oil to avoid this issue in the future. The rice was cooked evenly throughout, if slightly overdone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The only real downside to this model is in the durability department. The blue exterior held up very well, but there were some spots of discoloration, particularly on the handles where oil splattered while cooking on the stovetop. And while this product is dishwasher safe, the discoloration did not improve after washing. The enamel interior also sustained some damage when hit with the metal spoon, so we’d recommend using wooden utensils only.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For the low price point, this is a great entry-level item. If someone wants a Dutch oven that they will use occasionally for entertaining that looks great on the shelf, this would be a great option. In terms of durability, we'd suggest a stronger option for anyone looking to get a lot of use out of their oven. All in all, this model cooks beautifully but needs to be handled with care.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>12 x 8 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 12 pounds | <strong>Materials: </strong>Cast iron with enameled interior, exterior, lid, and handles; stainless steel knob</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-le-creuset-enameled-cast-iron-signature-round-dutch-oven-725-qt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Splurge</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Le Creuset Enameled Cast Iron Signature Round Dutch Oven, 7.25 qt.</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Le Creuset Enameled Cast Iron Signature Round Dutch Oven, 7.25 qt." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/KYiLjQQeuxELcSi5G3IFk39Uo4s=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/amazon-le-creuset-725-quart-round-dutch-oven-7d8f3ec909864577b092a5a942479eb2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>This Dutch oven has excellent heat distribution and retention.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The tight-fitting lid retains moisture.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It has ergonomically designed handles and a knob for easy lifting.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Even casual cooks have likely heard of Le Creuset, which is popular for a reason. Consider this Dutch oven an investment. If you’re paying hundreds of dollars for a Dutch oven, you should have high expectations for it. Fortunately, this one met our expectations and more. While it's more of a splurge than others, we felt that it was worth the cost for its heirloom quality and its exceptional performance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In our test kitchen, the chicken browned and cooked perfectly for our jambalaya recipe, and the meat released easily. It also has a tight-fitting lid that retains moisture, and the ergonomically designed handles and knob make it easy to lift. The rice cooked very evenly as well, and the texture was consistent throughout the dish. That said, we did note that the rice seemed slightly overcooked — it had a slightly softer bite than you'd get with rice cooked al dente.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This Dutch oven endured mild damage in our durability test, and the interior of the pot showed signs of the spoon’s impact. (Think: An eggshell that’s cracked but still intact.) We didn't note anything that would interfere with the pot’s performance, and there were no marks on the outside or on the lid.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The oven's thick enameled cast iron base takes more than a few minutes to heat, but it retains heat really well. The center gets hotter than the edges, as evidenced by how the chicken closest to the middle browned better in testing. But, this Dutch oven distributes heat quite evenly, especially given its large size — just sautéing vegetables released enough liquid to deglaze the pot, and the vegetables didn't need extra oil to keep from sticking. The Dutch oven's smooth surface really rivals a nonstick pan's; you don't have to put in much effort to see great results.</p><p>Our splurge pick takes barely any elbow grease to scrub clean, and it’s also dishwasher safe — an excellent choice for the serious chef.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>14.75 x 11.25 x 7.75 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 15.2 pounds | <strong>Materials: </strong>Cast iron with enameled cast iron lid; light interior coating; stainless steel lid knob</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cast-iron-lodge-5-quart-cast-iron-double-dutch-oven></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Cast Iron</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lodge Cast Iron Double Dutch Oven</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lodge 5-Quart Cast Iron Double Dutch Oven" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/9rFaMfF_Sr2xXbUdYaT4bMXVqcg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/amazon-lodge-cast-iron-dutch-oven-7-quart-95c03972b8f24ece83604a186cdf49ee.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Another delicious dish came by way of this Lodge Dutch oven. In our jambalaya, the chicken thighs browned very well and came out nice and crispy with sufficient heat — no sticking and crowding. The rice was cooked perfectly as well, with no sticking or burning, and the pot essentially looked clean after cooking.</p><p>The Lodge Cast Iron Dutch Oven is a strong and steady pick. We found it to be extremely durable, with no scratches or dents following our durability test. We couldn’t even tell that it had been hit. This is a super sturdy product that will hold up for many years to come. It even has a bonus feature: the lid doubles as a cast iron skillet (so handy, right?). The one drawback we noted is the size of the handles: they're on the narrow side, which makes it difficult to grab them with thick oven mitts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With a low price point in this category, the Lodge Dutch oven is an amazing value. You can use it for any type of cooking — stews, soups, sauces, and it’s great for browning, roasting, and even baking as well. It's easy to use and easy to clean, so there’s no learning curve if you’re new to cooking with a Dutch oven.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>12.56 x 4.5 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 14 pounds | <strong>Materials: </strong>Pre-seasoned cast iron interior and exterior; cast iron lid</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-shallow-staub-55-quart-round-cocotte></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Shallow</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Staub Round Cocotte</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Staub 5.5-Quart Round Cocotte" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/8WnE1B9FEsOOsQxcDYkUG3_vfcM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/staub-round-dutch-oven-4e5e9a79b1914b18983bc2d229cea0fa.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Crate & Barrel</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Potholders fit very easily into the wide handles of this Staub Dutch oven, our pick for the best shallow option. Although shallow, it's still super roomy — we were able to cook about a pound of chicken at one time. The Staub produced deep brown caramelization on the chicken, with a solid crisp when cutting. Very even heating across the bottom of the pan led to an even browning on the meat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We were just as successful with the rice, which came out perfectly cooked, just shy of al dente.

It has a beautiful porcelain-enamel finish that comes in several colors and doesn't transfer flavors to the food. For transporting the pot, its handles are rather small, so it might be challenging to fit a thick oven mitt into the handle openings, but it's easy to grab onto the handles when using kitchen towels.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With ample space for three or four sizable chicken thighs, this pot browns meat well and the thighs released easily in our testing, though one got a bit stuck toward the center of the pot. The rice cooked well, achieving a perfect texture. The only downside was the rice around the edges of the pot turned out a bit browned.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In our durability testing, the interior began to show signs of damage after repeat hitting, but for the most part, it held its own and did not significantly worsen or lead to chipping.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This Dutch oven took a while to heat the oil and bring liquids to a simmer, which isn't totally surprising given its thick base and large diameter. But, once it did heat up, it was really easy to work with (this also means you generally don't have to worry about overcooking). After we removed the lid to uncover perfectly cooked rice, we had a lot of confidence in this Dutch oven and how it might perform with other recipes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As for the value, while it's not necessarily inexpensive, it would be a great choice for anyone who wants to see what a good Dutch oven is capable of without investing hundreds of dollars. It performed almost as well as the higher-end models that cost significantly more, plus it's dishwasher-safe so it's easy to clean. The bottom line: while this Dutch oven may not be the best-in-class, you can still count on it to yield great results.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>12.99 x 12.99 x 6.22 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 17.8 pounds | <strong>Materials: </strong>Cast iron with porcelain enameled interior, exterior, lid, and handles</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-with-glass-lid-calphalon-premier-hard-anodized-nonstick-85-quart-dutch-oven></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best with Glass Lid</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Calphalon Premier Hard-Anodized Nonstick 8.5-Quart Dutch Oven</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Calphalon Premier Hard-Anodized Nonstick 8.5-Quart Dutch Oven" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/bYSR7WatsEb5IRyhKKMogsLuSHE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/calphalon-premier-hard-anodized-nonstick-85-quart-dutch-oven-942a425826874855871e3aac0d1f0dfa.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>It's lightweight and easy to transfer.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It has a durable nonstick surface.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It's dishwasher-safe for easy cleaning.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you like to have an easy bird's-eye view of your dinner, a Dutch oven with a glass lid may be a good fit for you. This Calphalon Dutch oven was our favorite with this feature. Despite the large size of the pot, in our testing, the rice came out perfectly cooked; the chicken was a little more blonde than brown with just a light sear. This Dutch oven has nice large handles and is lightweight, so it’s easy to pick it up with oven mitts.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After hitting it with a spoon in our durability test, there was a little denting and chipping on the outside of the Dutch oven, but the inside did not have a single scratch.

In terms of longevity, the only issue we can foresee is erosion of the nonstick coating which tends to happen with less expensive pots, but if taken care of well, it should last a very long time.</p><p>You could easily brown an entire roast in this oven with room to spare for your vegetables when it comes time to braise, and the nonstick coating made this dishwasher-safe piece a breeze to clean.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>17.52 x 15.94 x 12.6 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 5.5 pounds | <strong>Materials: </strong>Anodized aluminum with nonstick interior coating; tempered glass lid</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-12 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=3333 data-sizes=750px alt="Calphalon Premier Hard-Anodized Nonstick 8.5-Quart Dutch Oven" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/zS705K-hfKn5UUDPW5vVe6CGV2U=/fit-in/1500x3333/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PEO-CalphanlonPremierHardAnodizedNonstick8.5QuartDutchOven-11-WillDickey-268-73345c0ccd2549498b3de806751470b6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Will Dickey</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2666 data-sizes=750px alt="Rice dish inside Calphalon Premier Hard-Anodized Nonstick 8.5-Quart Dutch Oven on oven rack" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/uJLEO0rggD3BhaaHYBdkY1RqqzQ=/fit-in/1500x2666/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Testing-CalphanlonPremierHardAnodizedNonstick8-0f847bde497d46e48e16d5e4a6e3e78b.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Will Dickey</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-most-versatile-kitchenaid-seasoned-6-quart-cast-iron-dutch-oven></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Most Versatile</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>KitchenAid Cast Iron Dutch Oven</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="KitchenAid Seasoned 6-Quart Cast Iron Dutch Oven" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/g3fIUj79AYK0NIa1bj5zm41_k4A=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/kitchenaid-seasoned-6-quart-cast-iron-dutch-oven-4e688185b69144359525f63b1d9a0c58.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>This Dutch oven has excellent heat distribution and retention.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It includes a self-basting lid.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It cooked evenly in our tests.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Not only is this model beautiful, but during our tests, the browning on the chicken was absolutely lovely. We also appreciated the ample room in this Dutch oven, as well as the lack of sticking when the meat was done cooking. The KitchenAid model hit the mark with the rice, too, which was cooked to perfection thanks to the self-basting lid, with no sticking or burning. This Dutch oven has excellent heat distribution and retention, which led to evenly cooked foods in our tests, In the end, the taste of the ingredients was almost perfect.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This model stood up to our durability test with no scratches or dents.

The flat, solid handles make lifting and holding the product a bit more difficult, but the value is a great selling point. While KitchenAid might not be the first brand you think of when buying a Dutch oven, we found that this product performed well in cooking, durability, and cleanup. It would hold up to any number of tasks, including braising, roasting, and cooking soups and sauces, as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>15.9 x 14.2 x 9.9 inches&nbsp;| <strong>Weight:</strong> 18.3 pounds| <strong>Materials: </strong>Cast iron interior and exterior; cast iron lid with stainless steel knob</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-14 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=3333 data-sizes=750px alt="KitchenAid Seasoned 6-Quart Cast Iron Dutch Oven" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/XwhvloArz8s3QkkU61qXr7sXr1Y=/fit-in/1500x3333/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PEO-KitchenAidSeasoned6QuartDutchOven-27-WillDickey-321-b84a9ec407304c4880f45cde561c89ec.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Will Dickey</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2666 data-sizes=750px alt="hand flipping meat in KitchenAid Seasoned 6-Quart Cast Iron Dutch Oven" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/WeVMRlEv1XhDJWafojhd5yUtFX8=/fit-in/1500x2666/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Testing-KitchenAidSeasoned6QuartDutchOven-27-WillDickey-1214-248-8caadb514c704b8cadb7e33977c03445.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Will Dickey</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-eco-friendly-caraway-dutch-oven></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Eco Friendly</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Caraway Dutch Oven</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Caraway Nonstick Ceramic Dutch Oven Pot with Lid " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/WP9qWNoTA35LxTCIn8VlF7j4gaY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/caraway-nonstick-ceramic-dutch-oven-pot-with-lid-ca87890984ab40a5960cf3e618d44a89.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=0><p>It has large, easy-to-grasp handles.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It's made with a nonstick ceramic coating.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It provides excellent heat distribution and retention.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It's lightweight and easy to carry.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There was plenty of space inside this adorable Caraway Dutch oven, which is lightweight with large handles so it's easy to pick up with oven mitts or pot holders. Browning in this Dutch oven was very easy and elicited good results. The chicken thighs got a nice, even brown color, but the slipperiness of the nonstick enamel made it so that no crispiness was achieved during testing. On the flip side, food didn’t stick to the slick surface. The rice was overcooked in most of the Dutch oven, perhaps due to excessive moisture retention.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We were impressed by how easy it was to sear food in this model, though the chicken did not elicit a fond because the surface was so slippery. While the chicken did not have any crispiness, this Dutch oven did produce decent and continuous coloring throughout the meat thanks to its great heat distribution.&nbsp;On top of that, it stood up extremely well in our durability test, with only minor cosmetic scratches after 25 aggressive raps with a metal spoon.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This model has a lot of capacity, versatility, and durability for the price. With a modern, streamlined look and an extremely user-friendly ceramic coating, beginner to advanced chefs alike will enjoy using this Dutch oven. However, anyone looking to develop a flavorful base for stews and soups using fatty meats would be better suited using a different Dutch oven. (Those who won't be cooking a lot of meat and don't necessarily mind not having fond as the base for stews might love this Dutch oven.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>15.47 x 12.68 x 6.14 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 6.2 pounds | <strong>Materials: </strong>Cast iron covered in glossy enamel; stainless steel handles</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-16 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=3333 data-sizes=750px alt="Caraway Dutch Oven" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/j0uGubYCXKo-XkR99Nkx7WAdOaE=/fit-in/1500x3333/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PEO-CarawayDutchOven-21-WillDickey-298-ed8a6b8267e74298bcca967192131f29.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Will Dickey</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2666 data-sizes=750px alt="Hands in oven mitts placing Caraway Dutch Oven on oven rack" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/I3CImJ_qZJPYtm6YsrsTeRl1qo0=/fit-in/1500x2666/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Testing-CarawayDutchOven-21-WillDickey-1067-108-61f811e7e3314b92a7496ed072731e68.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Will Dickey</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-things-to-consider-when-buying-a-dutch-oven></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Things to Consider When Buying a Dutch Oven</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Price and Lifespan</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A good Dutch oven can cost you several hundred dollars, but if you're a serious cook looking to invest in a quality product, the high price tag might be worth it. “One thing to keep in mind as you set your budget is that cast iron lasts a really long time — I still use my grandmother’s cast iron pans,” Chef Matt Abdoo, author of Pig Beach BBQ Cookbook, tells PEOPLE. “However, you don't have to spend a fortune to get a good quality Dutch oven.”&nbsp;In fact, our top overall pick, the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Cuisinart Classic 5-Quart Dutch Oven</a> is less than $100.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Look for durable materials that will last for years to come, like the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Lodge Cast Iron Dutch Oven</a>, which showed no signs of wear and tear during our durability test. Or opt for a tried-and-true classic like Le Creuset.

As our testers noted above, choosing a Dutch oven with an extra large capacity can make it more difficult to whip up smaller batches. So before you purchase that beautiful 7.5-quart Dutch oven, consider how often you'll be whipping up large batches of stew versus everyday meals like chicken and rice.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Weight<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Cast iron can also get heavy — and that’s before you add ingredients to the pot.

The round shape is more versatile as it will work equally well on the stovetop or in the oven, while the oval shape is better suited for the oven. If you frequently entertain or like to roast large quantities of beef, pork, or chicken, an oval Dutch oven might be a good fit. If most of your Dutch oven cooking involves soups and stews, a round shape is a better choice.<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Materials</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Abdoo recommends a cast iron Dutch oven with an enamel-coated interior and porcelain exterior. “The enamel makes it easier to clean, and the porcelain prevents it from rusting,” he says. Top Chef star and author of Northern Soul Justin Sutherland tells PEOPLE that cast iron is a must “because it retains heat and releases heat evenly into food." He adds that you should make sure the cast iron is thick and even throughout the whole oven.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sutherland adds that buyers should take note of the lid's material and design as much as the oven itself. In addition to ensuring the lid is tight-fitting, he says: “Make sure the inside of the lid has round dimples or spikes — it helps the condensation fall back onto the food evenly to keep it based while cooking.”<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Will Dickey</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-63e57a6f-a941-4c60-8afb-809cf989c3dd></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=48.364259028643><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>When would you cook with a Dutch oven?</span></p><p>Dutch ovens are an ideal choice for preparing anything that requires moist heat. Stews, sauces, and soups are popular choices, but you can also brown and braise meat and vegetables in a Dutch oven or cook rice, as we did in our testing. Dutch ovens are especially good at heat retention, so you can use them for a range of tasks, from searing meat on the stovetop to slow cooking in the oven.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How do you cook with a Dutch oven? On the stove top or in the oven?</span></p><p>Both! We used both methods in our testing. Depending on what you are cooking, you may employ both a stovetop and an oven method, or just one of the two. For example, seared meat is best done on the stovetop, while a roast would need the power of the oven to cook over a longer period of time.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Will an inexpensive Dutch oven still work well?</span></p><p>Given that cast iron cookware doesn’t need to be expensive to perform well, it’s not necessary to splurge on a pricey Dutch oven. “The one I personally use is the Lodge Dutch oven, which is approximately $45,” says celebrity chef Matt Abdoo of Pig Beach BBQ. “It has all the features you need for a very good value.”</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.80963302752294><p><span class=accordion__title>Are Dutch ovens dishwasher safe?</span></p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-we-tested></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How We Tested</span></h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Cooking Evaluation: </strong>We put two dozen Dutch ovens to the test by cooking two different recipes that allowed our testers to evaluate how each product seared meat, sautéed vegetables, and cooked rice. Our chicken jambalaya recipe showcased each Dutch oven's stovetop and slow-cooking capabilities, while our simple rice recipe revealed if the sides of the Dutch oven cooked the rice at a higher temperature than the center and vice versa.</li><li><strong>Durability Test: </strong>To evaluate durability, our testers hit the lid and the interior of each Dutch oven 25 times with a metal spoon. Then they took note of any damage or chipping that occurred. Finally, testers scored the value of each Dutch oven when they learned the price of each model — after completing testing.</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-trust-people></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Trust PEOPLE?<br></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Rennie Dyball</a> is an experienced commerce writer.
