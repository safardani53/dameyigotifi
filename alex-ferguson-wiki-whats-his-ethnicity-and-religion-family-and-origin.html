He is regarded as one of football’s all-time great managers, having won more titles than any other manager in the sport’s history.</p><p>Ferguson is usually lauded for favoring youth at Manchester United, particularly in the 1990s with the “Class of ’92” who helped the club become one of the richest and most successful in the world. Ferguson was a striker who played for Dunfermline Athletic and Rangers among other Scottish clubs.

Ferguson, a Protestant who married a Catholic, regularly speaks out against Protestant intolerance in his hometown of Glasgow. The wife of Alex Ferguson has told how sectarianism in Glasgow almost wrecked their marriage. In the week when Ferguson is conducting the greatest takeover in football history, Cathy has detailed how the marriage overcame religious differences between her Catholic family and Alex’s Protestant parents. It would have been difficult for the couple to marry in a church 30 years ago unless one of them converted. She said that one of them was being pressured by their families to convert to another religion so that they could marry in a church, but neither of them would budge.</p><p>Instead, Alex and Cathy chose a simple ceremony in Glasgow’s Martha Street registration office. Alex was instrumental in Manchester United’s £625 million purchase of BSkyB.&nbsp;She believes she is no longer bothered by the fact that she was refused a church ceremony because of their opposing religious views. The problems with Alex’s wedding were just manifestations of spiritual turmoil that had consumed his whole life.</p><h2>Alex Ferguson’s Family and Ethnicity</h2><p><strong>Alexander Chapman Ferguson</strong>, the son of Elizabeth and Alexander Beaton Ferguson, was born on December 31, 1941, in Glasgow’s Govan area, at his grandmother’s home on Shieldhall Road.&nbsp;His father worked at a shipyard as a plater’s assistant.
