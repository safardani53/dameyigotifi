A voice that for so long we were all told wouldn’t make a difference and wouldn’t be heard.”</p><p class=p1>Austen praised his colleagues for holding their heads high despite their alleged inappropriate experiences with Schwahn, 51. “We came together to work in a place that promised safety, security and respect for all and despite one individual’s efforts to destroy that, you overcame,” the <i>Grantchester </i>star continued. “Today you are stronger and braver than you’ve ever been allowed to think you are.”</p><p class=p1>The <i>Jo </i>actor then reaffirmed his unwavering support for his colleagues: “To all who watched the show — know these women are bigger heroes than anyone could have ever hope to write them in a script. I give every last ounce of my support to you as I always have and always will, you are changing the way for those who will follow us and allowing this to become all of our new normal.”</p><p class=p1>As previously reported, numerous have come forward with sexual harassment claims against Schwahn. <i>The Royals</i>’ <strong>Alexandra Park</strong> <a href=#>shared her alleged experience</a> in a statement on Twitter on Wednesday, November 15. “I have a responsibility as someone who was working under Mark Schwahn on <i>The Royals </i>to acknowledge these claims,” the 28-year-old actress wrote. “I am devastated to admit to myself, my colleagues, and to this industry that I to, have been exposed to this reprehensible behavior.”</p><p class=p1>Park’s costar <a href=#><strong>Elizabeth Hurley</strong></a>, who says she has never experienced Schwahn’s alleged behavior,<a href=#> has also spoken out about the claims.</a> “I have loved working alongside Alexandra and Mark for four years while shooting <i>The Royals</i>, and had absolutely no idea that she was feeling frightened and sexually intimated by Mark during this time,” the 52-year-old actress wrote in an open letter on Twitter. “I have never thought of myself as unobservant, in fact quite the opposite, but I missed this and feel like I have let down a younger cast member. I could have helped her. I would have helped her. But I didn’t know.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><i>One Tree Hill </i>alums<a href=#><strong> Sophia Bush</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Hilarie Burton</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Bethany Joy Lenz</strong></a>,<a href=#> <strong>Jana Kramer</strong> </a>and more have also <a href=#>condemned Schwahn and accused him of sexual misconduct during their show</a>, which aired from 2003 to 2012.</p><p class=p1><a href=#>E! suspended Schwahn from the network</a> on Wednesday, November 15. “E!, Universal Cable Productions and Lionsgate Television take sexual harassment allegations very seriously, investigate them thoroughly and independently, and take appropriate action,” the network said in a statement to <i>Us Weekly</i>. “Lionsgate has suspended Mark Schwahn from <i>The Royals </i>as we continue our investigation.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatoJViv7DFwKWqZqyfonqiwdKtnKdlo6q9sbvRrapmm5%2BowaK%2B0maYn6yVp3qurdGkZKybmKyuqbqMmqOlnZeWwaq7zaxm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-walking-dead-cast-before-they-were-stars.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Walking Dead Cast: Before They Were Stars...</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./even-her-mom-thinks-jessica-simpsons-singing-blows.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Even Her Mom Thinks Jessica Simpson's Singing Blows</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
