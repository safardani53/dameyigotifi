And, even if his father had no involvement in his life, Joey had a mother figure and younger sister to take of.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Maryland, although it was one of the wealthiest states in the US, headlines about the crimes and rise of gangs always made rounds in the news and newspapers.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>So, it wasn’t easy to avoid and not get involved; nonetheless, Dorsey understood what his mother did for her children to feed them and educate them.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>From working more than 2 or 3 jobs without rest and complaints, a smile plastered in her face all the time, bringing gifts during Christmas and other holidays, his mother did all. Hence, he worked hard for his mother to return everything she did for him.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Another person who helped Joey focus on the right track was a former basketball player and comedian Gerald Brown or @geesongzz from Baltimore, who unfortunately got killed in the 2019 Northwest Baltimore Shooting.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He remembers, “One day I was sitting somewhere in a corner when Brown and his father pulled up on me and told me that this life was not for me and asked to join Douglas basketball teams mentioning that those corners would only lead to jail or death.”</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“And I remember going for practice and seeing what’s up with the team and winning in clean 28-0 for a state championship. So, that’s how I earned a brother and a life-saver.”</span></p><h2><span>Dorsey | Basketball Career</span></h2><p>After Gerald Brown called Joey to join Douglas High, he started playing for the high school team all his high school years, earning titles for the team.</p><p>And, after graduation, he directly went to join the University of Memphis to join Memphis Tiger’s men’s basketball. The four years in the university helped him learn to improve games, and as a result, he was able to pack his bag with seven titles (personal and team).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Joey-Dorsey-Barcelona-FC-Barcelona-1024x640.webp><p>In his final year, accompanied by <a href=#>Derrick Rose</a> and <a href=#>Chris Douglas-Robert</a>, Joey stole the 2008 NCAA Men’s Division I Basketball Tournament championship from Kansas in a 75-68 overtime.</p><h3><span>Professional Career</span></h3><p>Portland Trail Blazers picked the center in the 2008 NBA draft in the 2nd round as a 33rd overall but soon traded him to Houston Rockets, where he played 3 games for the season.</p><p>And without any other stable team, he made rounds between Raptors and Kings, finally settling in Spanish League club Caja Laboral for a year deal in 2011.</p><p>However, leaving the season in half, Dorsey soon joined Olympiacos, a Greek League team. He won the 2011–12 EuroLeague championship and the Greek League championship as a League Best Defender the same year.</p><p><strong><a href=#>&lt;&lt;&lt;Joe Ingles: Olympics, Autism Journey, Tweets & More>>></a></strong></p><p>In 2014, he re-joined the Rockets and had a season-best game with 7 points and 12 rebounds in a loss to the Golden State Warriors but couldn’t make a place for himself for further seasons in the team.</p><p>Soon, Galatasary of the Turkish League offered a $650,000 net income for a year-deal to Dorsey, leading him to leave the NBA. Then, he played for F.C. Barcelona for two seasons before getting waived for disciplinary reasons.</p><p>He appeared in 20 games in the 2018-19 season with another Greek Basket League team, Panionios B.C averaging 9 points and 8.8 rebounds in 22 minutes per game, trying to expand his deal.</p><p>Then he went to Germany in 2020, finally settling in Cyprus League with Apollon Limassol, and later making it to APOP Paphos B.C. Division A on September 4, 2021.</p><h2>Rewards and Recognition</h2><p>Rather than in the NBA, Dorsey has achieved more while playing for international teams, but his contribution in the NBA is not to be forgotten.
