Khloe was one of the last Kardashians to hear about the scandal, with her sisters breaking the devastating news to her.&nbsp;Kim Kardashian was at her home gym on that fateful December morning when she learned of Thompson’s latest infidelity scandal, which went a step further as he fathered a kid with model Maralee Nichols. The Kardashian-Jenner sisters were upset and had harsh words for the NBA player.</p><h2>Tristan Thompson’s paternity is revealed to Khloe Kardashian and her sisters.</h2><p>Kim called her mother, Kris Jenner, first and told her:</p><p>“This object contains the whole declaration. It’s the entire “I, Tristan Thompson, met this girl in Houston” thing. On my 30th birthday, I slept with her.’ So I emailed it to him with the question, ‘Does Khloé know about this?’ Khloé is completely unaware.”</p><p></p><p>Kylie Jenner, who was worried, called Kim and couldn’t believe the news at first, dubbing it a fake. Kim replied, frustrated:</p><p>“I’m not f**king lying. I’m trembling for her. My heart breaks for her.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Khloe-Kardashian-2.jpg alt="Khloe Kardashian" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Before Kim dug into the facts of Thompson’s papers filed in the paternity issue, where he acknowledged being intimate with Nichols, Kylie labeled the basketball star “the worst person on the earth.” Kourtney Kardashian joined the conversation as well, calling Kylie’s statements about Thompson’s frequent adultery “crazy” and a “never-ending swirl.” According to Kourtney,</p><p>“It’s a never-ending betrayal, that’s all.”</p><p>Kylie also expressed sympathy for Khloe:</p><p>“She is not deserving of this. This has to be her last indication.”</p><p>Kourtney agreed, adding the situation “couldn’t be much worse.” The show ended on a cliffhanger, hinting at Khloe’s response to the adultery.</p><h2>Khloe Kardashian’s previous relationships and marriages before Tristan Thompson</h2><p>Before she got involved with Tristan Thompson, the reality TV star had a few famous romances. Most notably, she married Lamar Odom in 2009 and later divorced him in 2013.</p><p><strong>Rashad&nbsp; McCants (2008-09)</strong></p><p>From late 2008 to January 2009, the Good American entrepreneur had his first public relationship with basketball star Rashad McCants. In an episode of Kourtney & Kim Take Miami, Khloé Kardashian accused Rashad McCants of cheating on her and “hooking up with ladies on Facebook.” McCants has consistently rejected the infidelity charges, saying in November 2009 that they “had already called it quits” before Khloé discovered the proof.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Rashad-McCants-1.jpg alt="Rashad&nbsp; McCants" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Lamar&nbsp; Odom (2009-13)</strong></p><p>Khloe Kardashian and Lamar Odom’s love progressed at breakneck speed, from meeting in August 2009 to being engaged a few weeks later. According to an insider, the couple “knew this was it” and married nine days after their engagement.</p><p>However, things quickly went from bad to worse. In a 2011 interview, Odom stated that their public romance “wore him down.” That year also saw a lot of turmoil in Odom’s personal life, leading to him driving while inebriated, excessive partying, drug usage, and serial adultery.&nbsp;Khloe Kardashian filed for divorce in December 2013, but the procedures were put on hold until December 2016 owing to Odom’s coma after an overdose. Throughout his rehabilitation, the former remained by his side.</p><p><strong>French&nbsp; Montana (April 2014-December 2014)</strong></p><p>Khloe Kardashian and French Montana’s brief romance, which started in April 2014, is best characterized as the reality star’s rebound. The couple seemed to have a wonderful connection, but Khloe Kardashian called it quits later in December after realizing she’d plunged in because she was “lonely and destructive” after her divorce from Odom. Montana remembers their connection warmly, calling it “dope” and “true love.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/French-Montana-1.jpg alt="French&nbsp; Montana" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>James Harden (June 2015-February 2016)</strong></p><p>Khloe Kardashian started dating NBA player James Harden in June 2015 after meeting him at a Kanye West-hosted party. During Odom’s overdose, Harden was “very supportive, genuinely understanding.” However, due to their clashing schedules, the couple seldom saw one other, eventually resulting in their split in February 2016. During their relationship, the NBA player said in a 2017 interview that he didn’t “enjoy all the attention.”</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiioaSfmnqsrdGdmKygmZa7bq3NnWStqpmowaK6jKucnJ2eqXqjvsSaoq6oXZa6qrCMrZ%2BeZZyWwbWx0axkqZmkmr%2BvtdOyZJynnqm%2FsMLEq6qyZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nikki-glaser-and-gleb-savchenko.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nikki Glaser and Gleb Savchenko</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./leon-brown-sister-wives-now.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Sister Wives' Star Leon Brown Now: They Are Now Married to Audrey Kriss</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
