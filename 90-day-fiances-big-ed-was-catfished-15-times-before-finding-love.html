I was catfished over 15 times. I had horrible, horrible luck,” the reality star, 55, exclusively told Us Weekly on Wednesday, January 20, while discussing the new series. He then teased of his current relationship, “We’ll see what happens. It’s still early. It’s kind of another roller coaster of a journey, somewhat like the Philippines.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/90-Day-Fiance-Big-Ed-Gets-Emotional-About-Finding-Love-Again-on-The-Single-Life.jpg><p>Ed starred on season 4 of 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days alongside <a href=#><strong>Rosemarie “Rose” Vega</strong></a>. He traveled to the Philippines to meet her in person after they connected online. The pair <a href=#>split</a> during a May 2020 episode.</p><p>Eight months after his rocky relationship with Rose, 25, Ed decided to <a href=#>put himself out there again</a>. “The show really kind of just follows me through my journey of what it’s like getting back into the dating life,” he explained to Us. “I hired a dating coach, which I got a lot of insight in who I am because one thing I revealed to her was who I wanted in a partner — you know, I wanted this, I wanted this and they don’t have to love me. And she’s like, ‘Well, wait a minute. Why not? Like, why don’t you think you deserve love?’ So, for me, it was therapeutic. The show was really therapeutic. And I found somebody. … She’s a wonderful girl.”</p><p>The TV personality grew emotional when he recalled his declaration that he did not need to be romantically involved with someone who loved him, noting that the dating coach “caught me off guard” when she questioned him about it.</p><p>“I think a lot of people in this world don’t think they’re good enough. And that’s sad. So you have to — I’m learning to believe in myself. I’m learning to love me for who I am and accept me for who I am. And that way somebody can love me, but you can’t — if you don’t love yourself, no one else will. And that’s the&nbsp;big&nbsp;thing,” he said. “And then I got a lot of pointers on, like, how you ask a girl out. For 28 years, I’m like, ‘Hey, you want to grab lunch? Hey, you want to hang out?’ No, she’s like, ‘No, no, no, no. … I want to take you out on a date, and repeat after me: I want to take you out on a date,’ and I did it.”</p><p>Ed told Us in April 2020 that he had “no” regrets about how his relationship with Rose played out. However, he conceded that the challenges were overwhelming. “First of all, I didn’t know what I was getting myself into,” he noted at the time. “I was in fear of my life. There was one night where I didn’t think I was gonna make it, and that’s the honest to God truth.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>90 Day: The Single Life and The Single Life Pillow Talk premiere on Discovery+ Sunday, February 21.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaHBpZZSWxm6yyJqlnJ2jYq%2Bqs4yem2avkah6pK3Tn6CsoJWZenKBjK2gpp2jYq%2Bmss6rnGaemaOxqrrGZqOorpVk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jeff-kuhner.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Jeff Kuhner net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-pasquale-rotella-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Pasquale Rotella Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
