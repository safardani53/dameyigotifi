The script for Gangs of New York, for instance, was written years before Martin Scorsese actually began producing it. And David Fincher's Mank sat in an icebox for a long time before the director brought his father's screenplay to life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>So while Don't Look Up debuted in 2021, the film was in development long before its release date. The movie was first announced in November of 2019, with Paramount Pictures negotiating a deal with Netflix several months later.</p><p>This means that Adam McKay got working on the script and its concept well before pre-production and principal photography were underway.</p><p>So while there are tons of people who would argue the film is a metaphor for the COVID-19 pandemic, the movie is, at its core, about climate change.</p><p>It's quite common for script changes to occur throughout production. Heck, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Russell Crowe revealed the script for Gladiator</a> only had 21 pages when filming began.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Don't Look Up also had its fair share of script changes, but not because there wasn't a script. Leonardo DiCaprio had requested a few adjustments before ultimately signing on. The Oscar-winning actor and globally popular leading man is known to be a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">proponent of climate change awareness</a>, so he presumably had some points he wanted to hit with the movie.</p><p>Filming was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It originally was supposed to begin in April of 2020 but was ultimately pushed back to November of later that year, and it officially wrapped in February of 2021.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Don't look up...

McKay says that it was a conscious choice to highlight the incompetence of leaders and technology's failure to save us in lieu of meaningful human action.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Meryl Streep's character, for instance, U.S. President Janie Orlean manages to escape to an alien planet on a secret spaceship with a bunch of other key government members, but she's devoured by space dinosaurs along with everyone else.</p><p>Her son (Jonah Hill) survives the wreckage of the comet but is left alone on a barren planet that's been decimated by the phenomenon.</p><p>In an interview with the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Los Angeles Times</a>, McKay said that he purposely didn't want everything to pan out in the film: "We’ve seen hundreds of movies where the world is about to end, whether it’s Marvel movies or James Bond or the ’70s disaster movies, and it always works out. I think it’s not crazy to say that maybe that’s part of the reason we’re not taking the collapse of the livable atmosphere seriously."</p><p>Don't Look Up is available to stream on Netflix. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">You can watch it with a subscription here</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmuoywmKxllKS7tXnLqKakZaWleri%2ByK2rnqY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./austin-meadows.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Austin Meadows</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./that-90s-show-actor-mace-coronel-5-things-to-know.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>That 90s Show Actor Mace Coronel: 5 Things to Know</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
