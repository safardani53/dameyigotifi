I’m an open book," <a href=#>Raven said of her decision</a> to tell Nick – and a national television audience.</p><p>"I think honesty is the best policy … especially when it’s something I’m nervous about and if this is someone I was spending my life with."</p><p>“We had to have those conversations, whether it’s embarrassing or if it’s uncomfortable," she adds. "I wasn’t nervous about telling him."</p><p>"I pretty much had my mind made up that I was going to. I was nervous about the night in general and just the seriousness of it."</p><p>"But I was not nervous telling him that. Just that day was nerve-wracking … it was so close to the end and it was a big night if that makes sense.”</p><p>It does. Again, though … did she or didn’t she?!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“Well, the thing about the show is they really capture those exciting moments and they make everything pretty true to what is happening."</p><p>“So I think I don’t really have to say too much."</p><p>"I think the show pretty much captured it.”</p><p>Guess we’re not getting the simple yes/no answer as to whether Nick gave Raven the inaugural sexual climax of her 25-year-old life.</p><p>One thing she wishes the show didn’t have to capture was Nick cutting her loose after she poured her heart out to him on the finale.</p><p>"I want you to know that I’m ready … I couldn’t be more sure, and I love you," Raven told him, only to be sent packing seconds later.</p><p>Why let her say all that if he’d already decided?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Asked about that post-finale, Gates said, "That was a question that was in the back of my mind that I didn’t get to ask him yesterday."</p><p>"But I did wonder why he didn’t give me [that] courtesy."&nbsp;</p><p>"But I also understand that he knows me well enough that he knows I love to say what I’m feeling, and I love to leave it all out on the table."</p><p>"So I really think he was just giving me that opportunity."</p><p>"I did have that question for him, so I am curious about it, but I felt like I already knew the answer," Gates said on a conference call.</p><p>"[Nick Viall] was going to say that he wanted me to leave it all out on the table because that’s ultimately what I would have wanted."</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Raven Gates Photos: Will She Win Nick Viall (and Bachelor Nation’s) Heart?</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><p>For his part, Viall revealed that he regrets doing that.</p><p>"I felt immense guilt … and I felt immense sadness … for putting Raven through that, and for that I’ll always be terribly sorry," he said.</p><p>"There’s no great way of doing it."</p><p>That’s true, and Viall dumped a lot of other people on TV who weren’t expecting it, as that sort of goes with the territory on this franchise.</p><p>Still, letting her say all that and dragging it out for effect left a bad taste in many viewers’ mouths – and apparently Nick’s in retrospect.</p><p>In any event, <a href=#>Nick Viall and Vanessa Grimaldi</a> are engaged, while Raven seemed happier on ABC’s After the Final Rose than they were.</p><p>As for what’s next for her, we are thrilled that Gates will be headed to Bachelor in Paradise … hopefully with the rest of these characters:</p><a href=#><img width=480 height=244 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/03/corinne-olympios-omg.gif alt="Bachelor in Paradise
