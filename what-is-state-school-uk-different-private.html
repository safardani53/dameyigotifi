education can be a big decision for parents.</p><p>State run <a href=#>schools</a> are available across the UK, but how can you ensure you choose the right environment to allow your son or daughter to blossom?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

authority.</p><p>They follow the national curriculum and have a rigid pay structure and conditions for <a href=#>teachers</a>.</p><p>Every child is entitled to a free place at a state school.</p><p>The schools cater for pupils from the age of five up until 18.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">READ MORE ON SCHOOLS</h2></p><p>Parents do not need to pay for a state school education, as they are funded by the government through national taxes.</p><p>But state schools do vary across the country, with <a href=#>parents</a> faced with different options for their child's education.</p><p>Community state schools are maintained by the local authority and follow the national curriculum.</p><p>They do not have influence from <a href=#>religious</a> groups or businesses, unlike foundation and voluntary schools.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">read more in news</h2></p><p>Faith schools also follow the national curriculum but can choose what they teach in religious studies.</p><p>Many schools have now become academies which are publicly funded, but are independent and have more control over deciding their own curriculum.</p><p>Some parts of the country still have a selective process at age 11, whereas others do not.</p><p>Parents who want their children to attend a <a href=#>grammar school</a> will see pupils selected by ability.</p><p>They will be tested, often with the <a href=#>11 plus exam</a>, in order to get in.</p><p>Despite being selective, grammar schools are also state schools as they are free and funded by the government.</p><h2>What is the difference between private and state schools in the UK?</h2><p>Funding is the main difference between private and state schools.</p><p>While state schools are government funded, private schools are financed by school fees paid by parents.</p><p>It can prove a lot more expensive to send your child to a private school but one advantage can be that these have more access to financial aid and can award scholarships.</p><p>The size of the classes can be significantly different also, with private schools focussing on a lower pupil to teacher ratio.</p><p>However, state schools can often offer far more subject choices within the curriculum.</p><p>Some feel that children can be exposed to more diverse communities within state schools, giving their children a far more rounded view of the world around them.</p><p>You may also here the term public schools.</p><p>In the UK these are the most exclusive private schools with pupils mainly boarding on site.</p><p>Parents have to pay school fees for their children to attend a public school.</p><p>For example, <a href=#>Eton</a>, Harrow and Winchester are the most widely known public schools in the country.</p><h2>How many state schools are in the UK?</h2><p>There are 3,473 state secondary schools in <a href=#>England</a>.</p><p><a href=#>Wales</a> has 1,470 state schools and <a href=#>Northern Ireland</a> has 511 as per data obtained for 2022.</p><h2>What is the best state school in the UK?</h2><p>The statistics for school performances tend to be based on exam performances and results that give parents all the information to make the right choices for their children.</p><h3>Henrietta Barnett School</h3><p>Based in <a href=#>Hampstead</a> in <a href=#>London</a>, this grammar school for girls is consistently near the top of the league tables each year.</p><p>It was named The Sunday Times Secondary School of the year in 2022 based on academic performance.</p><h3>Jordanhill School</h3><p>This comprehensive school in <a href=#>Glasgow</a> topped The Sunday Times <a href=#>Scotland</a> Secondary School of the Year by Academic Performance.</p><p>Uniquely, this primary and secondary school is funded directly by the Scottish Government.</p><h3>Ysgol Bro Preseli</h3><p>In Wales, the <a href=#>Pembrokeshire</a> school attained the envied title of the top state secondary school due to <a href=#>A-Level</a> and <a href=#>GCSE</a> results.</p><h3>St Mary's Grammar School, Magherafelt</h3><p>In Northern Ireland, St Mary's attained by far the best GCSE and A-Level pass rates, propelling it into top spot for parents looking where to send their children.</p><p>The grammar school is located in the town of Magherafelt in <a href=#>Derry</a>.</p><p class=postsid
