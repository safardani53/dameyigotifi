Rodgers proposed to the Texas native during the finale episode, <a href=#>getting down on one knee</a> for a second time three years later.</p><p>“Our first engagement was so real, and meant so much to us both, but as we start to actually plan our wedding for next year I wanted to do it all over again, OUR WAY,” the sports broadcaster explained via Instagram in August 2019 alongside video footage of his <a href=#>bonus proposal</a>. “So I bought a new ring, made a plan (that almost fell apart multiple times), and got down on one knee all over again.”</p><p>The twosome were forced to <a href=#>press pause on their ceremony multiple times</a> amid the coronavirus health crisis, finally exchanging vows at Sunstone Winery in Santa Ynez, California, earlier this year. Ahead of the big day, Fletcher exclusively told Us about the <a href=#>long road to the altar</a>.</p><p>“It’s been such a long time coming that, like, getting through the ceremony and walking into the reception to party and have fun with our friends, we’re so excited,” she gushed in April. “We can let our hair down and just be like, ‘We did it! You guys, like, we made it here. We’re doing it.'”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Pandemic delays weren’t the only challenge the duo faced. In May 2019, the Bachelor alum opened up about how <a href=#>a rough patch in the pair’s relationship</a> made them even stronger. “We’re in the best place ever, let me tell you,” she exclusively told Us at the time. “We’ve been very open about our first year being tough — it wasn’t the easiest. We had definitely some rocky, rocky moments, but those were growing years. And so, we are at the best stage we’ve ever been in our relationship. <a href=#>Life just keeps getting better</a>, you fall more in love. That sounds cheesy, but it’s true.”</p><p>Before The Big D, the couple cohosted their own home renovation-style series, Cash Pad, on CNBC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGoop9is62x05yfnqpdn7yzsMCnZKunlJyys7%2BMrJ%2Bor12ptaZ5waKeZpxdmK6vr8SlnJ1lkq56ta7SaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jingle-ball-2015-selena-gomez-one-direction-performance-pics.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Selena Gomez, One Direction &amp;amp; More Artists Perform Pics Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./farrah-abraham-talks-to-sophia-about-posting-feet-pics-gets-so-gross.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Farrah Abraham Talks to Sophia About Posting Feet Pics, Gets SO Gross</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
