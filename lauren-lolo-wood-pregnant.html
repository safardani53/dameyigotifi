While celebrities' popularity increases, their privacy can become non-existent — especially when it comes to their personal lives. With the pregnancy rumor mill always buzzing, every day another female celebrity is believed to be expecting a child. And <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lauren “Lolo” Wood</a> is no exception.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Lauren and Cleveland Browns player <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Odell Beckham Jr.</a> first went <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram official</a> in November 2019. Since then, the former <a href=#>Wild ‘N Out</a> girl and fitness trainer has been posting adorable snaps of her beau on social media.</p><p>After a certain photo surfaced online, pregnancy rumors went into overdrive for the couple. And now, it appears that Lolo has responded to the chatter. So, is Lolo Wood pregnant? Keep reading to find out.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Lolo Wood has confirmed that she is expecting her first child with Odell Beckham Jr.</h2><p>Oh baby! On Nov. 22, 2021, Lolo confirmed the news many fans expected — she is in fact pregnant with her first child! The model shared the news with fans and supporters <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">via Instagram with a slideshow</a> of herself and Odell posing for photos with her gorgeous bump on full display.</p><p>"I love you, I love you, I love you," Lolo captioned the photo.</p><p>Odell enthusiastically commented, “Can’t wait, baby!”</p><p>As expected, fans and fellow celebrities alike have flocked to Lolo's Instagram to congratulate the couple on their bundle of the joy.</p><p>"Yes congratulations beautiful," Nazanin Mandi commented. "OMG CONGRATS. So happy for you guys," supermodel Chanel Iman commented.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Social media users initially believed that Lolo Wood was expecting after a photo surfaced in October 2021.</h2><p>In October 2021, a photo of Lolo working out in the gym started to circulate online. At first, some fans believed it was nothing out of the ordinary since she works as a fitness trainer, but for others, the appearance of her stomach apparently told another story.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">image</a>, which was reposted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">OnSite!</a> on Oct. 5, 2021, Lolo can be seen standing in a blue fitness suit. And fans were quick to comment that it looks like her stomach area is protruding. As expected, social media users were pretty vocal with their opinions.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“Ugh I feel bad, women should be able to announce on their own time, congrats though,” one user commented.</p><p>“It’s beyond tacky that people don’t allow people to announce their own pregnancies anymore. What if they wanna wait 'til their second trimester? What if she was pregnant before and lost it and wasn’t ready to speak on it? People are taking this a lil too far,” another user commented.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fans believe that Lolo Wood may have privately confirmed her pregnancy back in September 2021.</h2><p>Internet sleuths are convinced that Lolo may have previously confirmed her pregnancy. An Instagram account, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@cloutbound_</a>, shared the gym photo during the week of Sept. 26, 2021.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>The Instagram account also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shared screenshots of Lolo allegedly sending someone a DM</a>, referring to having the photo taken down before.</p><p>“Lol girl I appreciate you sending this to me before it was spread,” Lolo allegedly wrote. “I had it taken down. Pls keep this between us.”</p><p>The other person then responded, “I got you Lolo. Love you and congratulations to you and O.” Lolo allegedly went on to thank the person for respecting her privacy.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>At this time, there is no telling if the screenshots are real. However, Lolo now confirming her pregnancy does make it seem like the screenshots are valid.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Lolo's net worth is surely set to skyrocket.</h2><p>Since Lolo was a former Wild 'N Out girl and works as a model, fans expect for the beauty to have a sizable net worth. And her net worth is likely steadily growing.</p><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MarriedBiography</a>, Lolo has accumulated a net worth of about $500,000. This figure is likely the combination of her appearance on the sketch comedy show, being a social media influencer, and working as a model. Lolo has also secured brand partnerships with Fashion Nova, Pretty Little Thing, and Boohoo.</p><p>Not to mention, since Lolo is focused on being a fitness enthusiast, it's safe to say that her net worth will continue to skyrocket — since she's expected to amass celebrity clientele.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>There's no denying that the pregnancy rumors were extremely invasive. Plus, it robbed Lolo of the opportunity to announce her pregnancy to the world. While fans are ecstatic that Lolo and Odell are going to be parents, hopefully this situation makes people to think twice before sharing pregnancy rumors.</p><p>Congratulations to Lolo and Odell on their bundle of joy!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoa62vsSnZKWnnKR6uLvOnWSpqpWcu6K60w%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./peter-parks-girlfriend-list.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Peter Parks Girlfriend: Who is Peter Park Dating?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./heartbreaking-tributes-to-precious-hussein-quig-diop.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Heartbreaking tributes to 'precious' boy, 13, killed being hit by a lorry in horror crash in Burton-</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
