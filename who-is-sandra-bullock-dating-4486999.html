Since 2015, Sandra and her late boyfriend <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Bryan Randall </strong></a>enjoyed a low-key romance, up until his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sudden passing</a> in Aug. 2023. His family confirmed the somber news in a statement to&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife</strong>. “It is with great sadness that we share that on August 5th Bryan Randall <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>passed away</a> peacefully after a 3 year battle with ALS. Bryan chose early to keep his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>journey with ALS</a> private and those of us who cared for him did our best to honor his request,” the statement read.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“We are immensely grateful to the tireless doctors who navigated the landscape of this illness with us and to the astounding nurses who became our roommates, often sacrificing their own families to be with ours,” they added. “At this time we ask for privacy to grieve and to come to terms with the impossibility of saying goodbye to Bryan.” Amid his passing, below is a closer look at Sandra’s dating history – including romances with <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ryan Gosling</a>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Matthew McConaughey</a>, </strong>and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jesse James</strong></a>.</p><h2>Sandra Bullock & Bryan Randall</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Sandra-Bullock-Everything-To-Know-BF-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Bryan Randall was a professional photographer and former model. Bryan – who died at 57 years old – ran a photography company called <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Bryan Randall Photography</a>. He also used to work as a model, posing for Harper’s Bazaar, Hugo Boss, Saint Laurent, and&nbsp;Vogue Paris in the 1990s. He also appeared in a 2011 issue of Harper’s Bazaar Singapore alongside <strong>Cindy Crawford</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Like Sandra, 59, Bryan was a parent. He has an adult daughter, <strong>Skylar</strong>, from a previous relationship. Sandra has <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>two adopted kids</a>: son <strong>Louis</strong> (b. 2010) and daughter <strong>Laila </strong>(b. 2012). Bryan has taken on the role of “raising the two kids with Sandra,” according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Us Weekly</a>, who also reports that he’s talking about <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wanting more children</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Bryan once dated <strong>Paris St. John</strong>, daughter of The Young and the Restless’ <strong>Kristoff St. John</strong> and boxer <strong>Mia St. John</strong>. Mia told Us Weekly in 2015 that Bryan was a “free spirit” who “couldn’t care less about money” and that he’s “kooky, goofy…so funny and very young at heart.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>As for date night, Sandra and Bryan often kept it low-key, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Us Weekly</a>. While the couple previously enjoyed an occasional night out in Los Angeles, hitting up Craig’s or somewhere fancy, supposedly their ideal date night was often “to send the kids upstairs and snuggle up on a couch with a pizza or a bowl of popcorn.”</p><h2>How Did Sandra Bullock & Bryan Randall Meet?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Sandra-Bullock-Everything-To-Know-BF-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>Sandra and Bryan first met in 2015, after he was hired to photograph her son Louis’ birthday part, per <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Us Weekly</a>. The couple kept their romance out of the spotlight for a few years before rumors of a possible marriage began popping up.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“For a year, I was by myself trying to date, and I’m telling you dating was the worst experience I ever had. I seem to have attracted everyone whose intentions were not the best,” Sandra said in a 1996 interview with Detour (h/<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>t E! News</a>). “They were nice people, but they just weren’t suited for me, and that’s hard because I seriously thought I’m never ever going to find anybody that will love me and just enjoy life.”<br></p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Most recently, in Nov. 2021, Sandra opened up to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Red Table Talk</a>&nbsp;about her thoughts on marriage. “I am someone who went through the&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>divorce process</a>. I found the love of my life. We share two beautiful children— three children, his older daughter. It’s the best thing ever,” she gushed at the time. “I don’t wanna say do it like I do it, but I don’t need a paper to be a devoted partner and devoted mother.”</p><h2>Sandra Bullock’s Past Relationships</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Sandra-Bullock-Everything-To-Know-BF-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12>“If you’ve never been around somebody that gives you that feeling of ‘Maybe this could be the one’ or enlivens you that way, I think you get a little scared. I don’t think [my character’s] ever…been across someone that she respected and admired enough to say, ‘You are worth battling it out with for a lifetime,’’ Sandra said in that 2013 interview with ET. “You’d like to know that that person could…make you laugh and think, can really stimulate you and excite you when you’re gone…somebody you can admire and be proud of and sit back and go, ‘This is my man.’ ”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>“Whether or not he’s a millionaire or if he’s a painter, a musician, or somebody who just shucks clams, I think it’s that respect level that we forget to look for,” she added. Sandra’s romantic history is full of artists, sports, and millionaires.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>She first began dating <strong>Tate Donovan</strong> while filming 1992’s Love Potion No. 9. Sandra and the O.C. alum stayed together for three years and were even engaged before calling it quits. In 1995, she had a brief romance with NFL star <strong>Troy Aikman</strong>. The following year, she revealed she was dating film tech, <strong>Don Padilla</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>“[He’s a] really sweet person,” she told&nbsp;Detour of her then-unidentified boyfriend. “It’s been rough because of all this that happened, plus he’s working all the time, and I rarely get to see him.” They were together for about ten months, and she told <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rolling Stone</a> in 1997 that the breakdown of her relationship with Padilla affected her work on A Time To Kill.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>“I had to look at myself and go, ‘I’m responsible for so many things now, what am I choosing to hold close to my heart? And what do I choose to let go of and not control?’ You learn what you’re made of,” she said. “I could have thrown in the towel, or I could just put my head down and say, ‘OK, give me a windbreaker, I’m going in.’ And it was beautiful to realize that your friends are not just hanging in for the good times. ‘Cause the good times mean absolutely nothing at all.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Sandra-Bullock-Everything-To-Know-BF-embed-4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-17>Sandra worked opposite Matthew McConaughey on A Time To Kill.

I feel very cared for by Matthew.

From 2002 to 2003, she and Ryan Gosling were an item. After Sandra and Ryan split, she met motorcycle mechanic/entrepreneur/reality television star, Jesse James. The couple first crossed paths while she took her nephew on a tour of his Long Beach shop, per <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>E! News</a>, leading to a romance that ultimately saw them tie the knot in July 2005. The couple split in 2010 after he <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>cheated</a> on her.
