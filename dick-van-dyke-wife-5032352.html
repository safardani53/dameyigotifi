However, before she and Dick said their “I Do’s,” Arlene kept busy with her make-up artist career in Hollywood. In fact, that’s how she and the 97-year-old met and soon after that, Dick would hire Arlene for more events. Later, in 2013, she gushed about her man to the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Huffington Post</a>. “We take very good care of each other. But, I’m very aware that I have a national treasure on my hands,” she told the outlet at the time.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Not only is she a makeup artist, but Arlene is also gifted with a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>beautiful voice</a> like her long-time love. Dick is such a fan of Arlene’s singing, that he often posts about it via his <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram account</a>, as he did on June 7, 2021. “Blue Skies by Arlene & <strong>Ella</strong> During the commercial breaks of the @kennedycenter broadcast, the Mrs. @bijoubox sang a little ditty with @firstladyofsong @spotify,” he captioned the sweet clip.</p><h2>His Marriage With Arlene Silver</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Arlene and Dick <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>got married</a> about six years after they met in 2012.
