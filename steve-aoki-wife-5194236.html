While Steve, 45, has been involved in music since the 90s, it’s been more recent years that he’s established an undeniable presence as a producer and performer. He’s been one of the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>highest-grossing EDM artists,</a> and he’s boasted collaborations with a wide variety of<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> stars across the music world,</a> including the likes of <strong>Lil Jon, Will.I.Am.,&nbsp;</strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>BTS</a>, Fall Out Boy, and many more.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Steve will also be performing</a> at the halftime show for the Seattle Seahawks game against the San Francisco 49ers on Thanksgiving Day on Thursday, November 23. The NFL and Seahawks announced that Steve would be their halftime performer earlier in November.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>What some fans may not know is that Steve was married to his ex-wife&nbsp;<strong>Tiernan Cowling&nbsp;</strong>for two years from 2015 to 2017. Find out more about Steve’s ex-wife here.</p><h2>Steve and Tiernan Used to Work Together</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/steve-aoki-ex-wife-tiernan-cowling-embed1.jpg alt width=620 height=930 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>While it’s not entirely clear how Tiernan first crossed paths with the DJ, the two of them did have a professional relationship early in their engagement. Tiernan served as the creative director for Steve’s merch company, where she also oversaw collaborations and licensing deals, according to her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>LinkedIn</a> profile.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Tiernan also served as the creative director and co-founder of the Dim-Mak collection from 2014 to 2016. In her description on LinkedIn, she noted her connection with Steve. “I am the creative director and co-founder of Dim Mak Collection, a high-end mens street-wear brand, with my partner Steve Aoki,” she wrote.</p><h2>She’s a Former Model</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Prior to taking on more behind-the-scenes roles in fashion, Tiernan was a model herself. Her LinkedIn page notes that she worked with Next Models LA from May 2010 to January 2015. She also notably studied at the Fashion Institute of Technology.</p><h2>The Couple Got Married in 2015, After a 5 Year Engagement</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Steve and Tiernan had gotten engaged in 2010, but details about their engagement were few. The pair didn’t tie the knot until five years later. The DJ’s rep revealed that he’d said “I do” to the former model in a statement to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Us Weekly</a>&nbsp;in December 2015. “Steve married his longtime girlfriend in a small, private and intimate ceremony in Maui yesterday in front of their families,” they said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/steve-aoki-ex-wife-tiernan-cowling-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>Unfortunately, the pair split just two years later. While details about the divorce are unclear, it was reported that it was an “amicable” breakup, and it was at least partially due to Steve’s heavy touring schedule, according to report from&nbsp;The Sun,&nbsp;via&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>AmoMama</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Tiernan Now Works for a Luxury Fashion Retailer</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>While Tiernan has mostly kept a low profile since her split from Steve, she does occasionally attend fashion events, and she’s continued to work in the industry. Her LinkedIn account now indicates that she works as a senior womenswear buyer for the Moda Operandi company.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9KtnK%2BdXZa8rLWMsKCfnV1qfnqAkWxtaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./episodes.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cheers Season 6 Episodes - Watch on Paramount+</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-simone-smith-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Simone Smith Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
