There, Janessa says, she expected doctors to confirm her suspicions that Nixon was simply experiencing “growing pains.” However, the doctor’s visit did not go as the couple planned.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Our doctor … took a couple X-rays then he came into the room and asked us to come out with him,” she says, noting that the doctor then showed the couple Nixon’s shocking results.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We went back and he pointed it out and said, ‘We found a tumor in him on his bone.’ ”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Janessa Whatcott</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The X-ray showed a tumor the size of an egg on Nixon’s left femur. The doctor said they’d need to determine whether the tumor was cancerous.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I was horrified. That’s every parent’s worst nightmare,” Janessa tells PEOPLE. “I was in total belief that it was growing pains, and that I was being overly worried. It was scary to figure that out and have to accept what that was.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The family went to a hospital in Salt Lake City where doctors determined that the tumor was cancerous —and found several smaller tumors also on the boy’s left femur.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“My husband and I lost it. We felt that loss that he’d been given this thing and we couldn’t take it away from him. There was nothing we could do for him. We were concerned what the cancer treatments would be. How were we gonna tell him?” the mom of four says.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Janessa Whatcott</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We were devastated for him. He’s such a happy go-lucky little boy and you’d never even think that he was sick. The day before, he was just running outside with his brothers. Looking at him, he didn’t look sick. It was almost unbelievable. We were just devastated. We couldn’t wrap our heads around it.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Over the next few days, the family learned that the cancer had spread to Nixon’s lungs and his arm. He has spent most of the months since in the hospital, and has undergone six rounds of chemotherapy. Janessa and Nick share health updates on a Facebook page called <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>NixonStrong</a>. Photos on the page show Nixon and his siblings sporting wide smiles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But Janessa says Nixon’s illness has taken a toll on the family.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Janessa Whatcott</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It’s really rocked the whole family. It’s been hard for [my sons] to not have me there in the mornings to take them to school or pick them up from school,” she says. “It’s hard for Nixon because Nixon misses his brothers. He misses playing with them, going to school and just being a kid. It affects every single person in the family in a different way.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now, Janessa says the chemotherapy has helped and the boy’s health is improving.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Janessa Whatcott</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Soon, he’ll have to undergo a rotationplasty, in which surgeons will remove his cancerous femur and knee. Nixon will then get a prosthetic which will function as his knee.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Nixon’s been frustrated having to come to the hospital a lot. It was hard for him because he wants to have a real leg, he doesn’t want to have a fake leg,” Janessa tells PEOPLE. “This has turned our lives upside down, but [Nick and I] just keep in mind that we only have to do this for a short time and he’ll be healthy.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5iarq3Ax2iZqLFda3qltcCgpairlZl6pK3NnJyrZZenvLi1zaBkqZmZo8Bw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-noah-taitano-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Noah Taitano Dating Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./james-watts-obituary-how-did-he-die-cause-of-details-explained.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>James Watts Obituary: How Did He Die?
