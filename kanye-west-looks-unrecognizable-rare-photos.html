California store for a visit on Friday rocking a new look.</p><p>The Chicago native had no hair on his head, a massive beard, and a big smile on his face.</p><p>He wore a grey shirt with red stripes across the chest and an emblem on one side.</p><p>He paired the top with a tight pair of leggings-style pants and green rubber boots that reached almost to his knee.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="More Kardashian News">More Kardashian News</h2><p>Kanye was spotted holding his phone in his hand as he stepped around a black Mercedez Benz.</p><p>The Flashing Lights singer has been keeping a relatively low profile after <a href=#>stirring major controversy</a> with comments online <a href=#>about the Jewish community</a>.</p><p>He also launched a series of attacks on his ex-wife <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> that raised some eyebrows.</p><p>He has been seen a few times attending events for his children North, Saint, Psalm, and Chicago but has otherwise mostly kept to himself.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>Kanye also has not been very active online.</p><h2>CHANGE UP</h2><p>In April, Kanye <a href=#>attended his daughter North's basketball game</a>, narrowly avoiding an awkward run-in with Kim, 42.</p><p>He was only at the game for a short time, seemingly stepping out before it started.</p><p>Photos from the sighting showed Kanye outside the arena.</p><p>He was sporting the same bald head from his recent outing but had a much bushier beard at the time.</p><p>He laid low, hanging out by his car at the Thousand Oaks, California sports complex.</p><p>Kanye appeared to be working hard to avoid Kim and did not hang around for very long.</p><p>He looked out into the distance, wearing several layers.</p><p>Kim, meanwhile, had on a white tank top and baggy blue and red track pants.</p><p>She accessorized with a fluffy black bag, shades. slides, and fashionable jewelry.</p><p>The Kardashians star looked calm and cool as she made her way into the game.</p><p>She was spotted sitting in the stands, taking in all the action.</p><p>She left with North, who had on a jersey and held a water bottle in her hand.</p><p>It appears the game, or something that happened inside the arena didn't sit well with Kim and Kanye's eldest child.</p><p>She was <a href=#>seemingly crying</a> while walking to the car.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

the couch alongside Albe with his youngest daughter sitting on his lap.</p><p>Chicago was wearing a pink Hello Kitty T-shirt, white pants and had her hair in two buns.</p><p>North stood slightly behind them and appeared to be jumping into the frame.</p><p>She had a Yeezy shirt on and wore her hair in a low poinytail.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The
