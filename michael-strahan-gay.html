Nicole was convinced that he was, in fact, with another woman.</p><p>After that, she yelled and cursed at him through the door, which got her kicked out of the hotel.</p><p>Despite ending their relationship in such an intense and dramatic situation, they remained friends after their split.</p><h3>Marianna Hewitt & Stefani Vera</h3><p>According to our sources, Michael was in a relationship with Marianna Hewitt; the two met each other in 2014 and started dating relatively soon.</p><p>They dated for quite a while before splitting up for good.
