Still, his father wasn’t absent from his life, and many of LeVox’s passions were inherited from his father. He talked about it&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">with the Chicago Tribune</a> back in June 2014. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>My (biological) dad was my soccer coach, my football coach and my baseball coach. He had a band. He played lead guitar. The skills he taught me helped make me an athlete. I’ve carried them with me the rest of my life.
