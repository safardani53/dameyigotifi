next season following Financial Fair Play breaches.</p><p>Charlton Athletic, who were relegated from the Championship on the final day of the season, later revealed they are considering legal action

src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1227765244.jpg><p>Wednesday will kick off the 2020-21 Championship season on minus-12 points following a lengthy investigation by the English Football League.</p><p>The verdict was reached by an independent disciplinary commission, not the EFL.</p><p>Wednesday, who finished 16th, would have been relegated to League One had the points deduction been applied to this season.</p><p>A statement from Charlton read: "We fail to understand why the deduction will take place next season rather than the current season, which seems to be irrational, and are writing to the EFL to get an explanation of the justification."</p><p>The EFL charged Wednesday in November for breaching Profitability & Sustainability rules&nbsp;relating to the £60million sale of their Hillsborough stadium.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Telegraph</a>, the punishment related to "how and when" it was sold.</p><p>Question marks were asked following the sale's subsequent inclusion in the 2017-2018 accounts when it was sold a year later.</p><p>Wednesday denied the charge and hit back by issuing a counter-claim against the EFL for allegedly "acting unlawfully".</p><p>They went in front of a three-person panel last month and the damning verdict was finally reached on Friday evening.</p><p>An EFL statement read: "An independent Disciplinary Commission, appointed under EFL Regulations, has ruled that Sheffield Wednesday will receive a 12 point deduction for breaching the League’s Profitability and Sustainability Rules for the three season reporting period ending with Season 2017-18. &nbsp;</p><p>"The sporting sanction will take effect in season 2020-21.</p><p>"The club was charged in November 2019 and referred to an independent Disciplinary Commission, which conducted a full hearing at the end of June 2020, before finding the Club guilty based on the fact that the Club should not have included profits from the sale of Hillsborough Stadium in the Club’s financial statements for the period ending July 2018.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Championship</h2></p><p>"The club was found not guilty of a further charge of breaching its duty of utmost good faith to the EFL by deliberately concealing information from the League in respect of filings made in respect of the Profitability and Sustainability Rules."</p><p>Wednesday have 14 days to appeal against the punishment.</p><p>It is believed the Championship side will look to appeal their penalty.</p><p class=postsid
