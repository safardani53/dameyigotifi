This all-around product not only produces fizzy water, it also makes flavored fizzy water (or still water, if you prefer). With four settings — still, light bubbles, classic seltzer, and max bubbles — this machine makes it easy to select your own carbonation level. It has room for two flavor cartridges, and Ninja has over 20 sweetened and unsweetened flavors to choose from. (Or you can combine flavors for your own unique flavored water.) The soda maker comes with eight flavors to start, and you’ll need to purchase the manufacturer’s brand of flavor drops once you run out. You can also adjust the flavor profile to classic or bold.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keep the included 48-ounce water reservoir in your refrigerator so the water temperature is always just right to make your own fizzy water (it includes an indicator to let you when it’s the ideal temperature). Pour the chilled water from the reservoir into the unit, and it will quickly dispense directly into your&nbsp;6, 12, 18, or 24-ounce glass. This unit does need to be plugged in, so you’ll need to make sure you have counter space available near an outlet. This product uses a screw-in CO2 canister (included) that can make up to 100 12-ounce drinks. You can replace the CO2 canister with a standard 60-liter canister or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">send it back to Ninja</a> for a replacement at a discounted price. This soda maker stood out from the rest in our testing, and we love that it allows you to adjust the amount of bubbles and the strength of the flavoring.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Power Source:</strong> Electric | <strong>Bottle Capacity:</strong> 6, 12, 18, 24 ounces | <strong>Carbonator Included: </strong>Yes<strong> </strong>| <strong>Dimensions: </strong>14 x 8.8 x 16 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-most-versatile-drinkmate-omnifizz-sparkling-water-and-soda-maker></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Most Versatile</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Drinkmate Sparkling Water and Soda Maker</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Drinkmate OmniFizz Sparkling Water and Soda Maker" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/NvjHmrfX2VQ3w8tGy25d7bmNd2A=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/drinkmate-omnifizz-sparkling-water-and-soda-maker-b0dbcf5cf68d4bd593209a318a167fbe.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>&nbsp;Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>The machine can carbonate any beverage.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The CO2 cartridges are compatible with any brand.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The bottles on this unit are easy to clean.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This impressive device performed well across all tests — from ease of use to carbonation performance — while also displaying exceptional versatility. The Drinkmate is one of the few soda makers that can be used to carbonate any liquid. Not only can you turn tap water to sparkling, but you can also add bubbles to juice, tea, or cocktails without having to worry about damaging the machine. The convenience of that feature alone ranked it high on our list, but it also earns high marks for a small counter footprint and a two-stage pressure-release valve that cuts down on excessive foam and spillage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Drinkmate doesn't require electricity or batteries and has a sleek design that comes in a variety of colors. It is also able to use CO2 cartridges from any brand, so you don't have to stress about locating proprietary products (though the manufacturer has a trade-in program that allows you to purchase discounted CO2 cylinders when you send back your empties).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We found that it provided a decent level of carbonation no matter the beverage, and the bottles open on both ends, making them easy to clean and dry. They're also very easy to attach to the unit, so they're simple to slide in and out with minimal hassle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The only downside: The CO2 canisters do have a tendency to run out relatively quickly, so be prepared to refill them more frequently than you'd like.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Power Source:</strong> Manual | <strong>Bottle Capacity:</strong> 1 liter | <strong>Carbonator Included: </strong>No<strong> </strong>| <strong>Dimensions: </strong>5 x 8 x 16 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-beginners-sodastream-fizzi-one-touch-sparkling-water-maker></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Beginners</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>SodaStream Fizzi One Touch</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="SodaStream Fizzi One Touch Sparkling Water Maker" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/jiEEv_s0Ys6XTe1dHSWePwL96bE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sodastream-fizzi-one-touch-sparkling-water-maker-07138e5accbd46ecaf0155e4c500c69c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>&nbsp;Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=1><p>The machine is fast, straightforward, and easy to use.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>You can adjust the carbonation level with the touch of a button.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">SodaStream is the biggest name in the soda machine market, with products that are incredibly fast, straightforward, and easy to use.

The bottles quickly snap into place, no twisting required, and feature an upscale-looking design with metal trim. It comes with a full CO2 cylinder capable of carbonating up to 60 liters, and SodaStream offers refills at a reduced cost, making this the best budget-friendly option. We also found this machine to have a nice, gentle fizz that felt full, providing a pleasant, refreshing drinking experience.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Size and power source are drawbacks: The SodaStream is larger than some other soda makers and has to be plugged in — a consideration if your counter space lacks available electrical outlets.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Power Source:</strong> Electric | <strong>Bottle Capacity:</strong> 1 liter, 0.5 liter | <strong>Carbonator Included: </strong>Yes<strong> </strong>| <strong>Dimensions: </strong>5.63 x 8.0 x 16.8 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-design-aarke-carbonator-iii-premium-sparkling--seltzer-water-maker></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Design</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Aarke Carbonator III Sparkling & Seltzer Water Maker</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Aarke Carbonator III Premium Sparkling &amp;amp; Seltzer Water Maker" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/iSee-hk2ojGyvh6JoG3dJujXYu8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/aarke-carbonator-iii-premium-sparkling--seltzer-water-maker-53b9d0abbb424fca802f7358c260bb79.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>&nbsp;Amazon</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you're okay with a bit of a splurge and want something that will make a stylish addition to your kitchen, the Aarke Carbonator III is the way to go. This Swedish-designed device is made from stainless steel and has a copper finish that makes for the most elegant look on the market. It also comes in a matte black, black chrome, brass, or stainless steel finish, so there are plenty of options to match your interior — and your personality.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Beyond its sleek, sturdy, and minimalist design, the Aarke Carbonator is also incredibly user-friendly. Don't let the fancy look fool you: It's designed to be as simple as screwing in the CO2 tank (purchase separately), screwing in the bottle, and pulling a lever. The entire process takes less than three seconds, and the machine vents the excess carbonation so bottles won't explode or make a mess.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We found it to be easy to use and even easier to clean. The number of bubbles made for enjoyable mocktails and cocktails, but for the price, the fizziness wasn't more exceptional than other selections on this list. Ultimately, the higher price point boils down to aesthetics alone. If you want a soda maker that draws attention for its sleek good looks, Aarke is worth the extra money.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Power Source:</strong> Manual | <strong>Bottle Capacity:</strong> 800 milliliters | <strong>Carbonator Included: </strong>No<strong> </strong>| <strong>Dimensions: </strong>6 x 10.2 x 16.3 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-features-twenty39-qarbo-sparkling-water-maker-and-fruit-infuser></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Features</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Twenty39 Qarbo Sparkling Water Maker and Fruit Infuser</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Twenty39 Qarbo Sparkling Water Maker and Fruit Infuser" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/fzcUFXH6OM27eiIab4xAS3lUP5g=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Twenty39-Qarbo-Sparkling-Water-Maker-and-Fruit-Infuser-ae94bc7a6d2c43b9a3b067341fffd9ef.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Twenty39 Qarbo makes it possible to carbonate any beverage, with the extra advantage of simultaneously infusing fresh flavors.

When it came to making mocktails and cocktails, the carbonation didn't hold up as well as the others, but the overall flavor far surpassed the competition.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Power Source:</strong> Manual | <strong>Bottle Capacity:</strong> 1 liter | <strong>Carbonator Included: </strong>No<strong> </strong>| <strong>Dimensions: </strong>17.64 x 11.54 x 5.12 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-things-to-consider-before-buying-a-soda-maker></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Things to Consider Before Buying a Soda Maker</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Ease of Use</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Most soda makers sound easy to use, but it's important to find out just how much is required to operate a machine before purchasing. Consider the process of carbonation and how many steps are required. Some only require the touch of a button, but others don't make it quite as simple. Many soda makers require CO2 cartridges, so it's important to know how easy they are to install, replace, and return/recycle.

If machines could be used to carbonate beverages other than water, we tested apple juice, natural wine, and various syrups for cocktails and mocktails. We also evaluated each soda maker for ease of use and cleanup, quality of fizziness, versatility, and more.</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-d87a6ae2-7f12-4cb7-96a7-d0e27d9d5b06></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=50><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active"><p><span class=accordion__title>How do soda makers work?</span></p><p>Soda makers work by injecting carbon dioxide into water to create effervescence. Most modern machines (and all the ones on our list) use pressurized CO2 cylinders to deliver carbonation.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How long do soda maker cartridges last?</span></p><p>Soda maker cartridges aka carbonating or CO2 cylinders make 60 liters of sparkling water. Another factor to consider is the level of carbonation you use — but generally, one cylinder will last from four to eight weeks.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Can you put flat soda in a soda maker?</span></p><p>Technically, you can re-carbonate previously carbonated beverages, although manufacturers don't recommend this. The sugar in the beverage can leave residue on your machine, and if you aren't careful, the soda can explode everywhere. The best thing to do is try to maintain the CO2 in your beverage by sealing it quickly after pouring.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How can you tell when the CO2 cylinder is empty?</span></p><p>There are several ways to tell if your CO2 cylinder needs to be replaced. The easiest way is to try to use the machine; if you don't hear the normal hissing of the escaping CO2 or if the machine is making sputtering sounds it may be empty. If you see that bubbles are not being emitted into the bottle, this could mean you need a new cartridge.</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-trust-people></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Trust PEOPLE?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Topher Gauk-Roger</a> is a Senior Producer and Writer at PEOPLE, and has been with the brand since 2020, producing field shoots and video content across all entertainment verticals, as well as writing and reporting for the digital news team.
