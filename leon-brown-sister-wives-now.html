"Unfortunately, I grew up in a context that was incredibly gendered and restrictive," they continued. "So I continued to be socialized as a girl and later a woman."</p><p>"I'm finally ready to share my favorite self with the world," they wrote. "And that self is incredibly genderqueer, trans, and unapologetic."</p><p>"Being queer and trans are definitely some of my favorite parts of myself," Leon added. "And yet, there are so many things that I am learning to love about myself through this process. Here's to me getting to know myself, share myself, and continually evolve to be the person I am, to be my favorite self in all contexts."</p><p>Shortly after Leon published their photos on Instagram, future spouse Audrey Kriss voiced their support by sharing Leon's post with stickers that read, "Love you now and always" accompanied by the trans flag. Audrey themself <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">came out as transgender</a> on Dec. 4, 2021, in a statement posted to Instagram.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Audrey Kriss (@audreykriss)</a></p></figure><p>Leon clarified at the bottom of their post that they are sharing this part of themself "to let folks in, and also to set some boundaries." They concluded: "If you choose not to use my correct name or pronouns, then you do not need to speak to or about me. My name is Leo or Leon, and my pronouns are they/them. Please only refer to me in that way."</p><p>The self-described "radical humanist" has earned the support of their mom, <a href=#>Meri Brown</a>, Kody's first wife, who was legally married to him until 2014 when they dissolved their marriage so Kody could marry Robyn and adopt her three children.
