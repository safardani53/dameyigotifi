I don't have to feel embarrassed anymore and think 'I don't want to look at myself'.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/BRENDA.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000689751315.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>"It's changed everything. I'll go out more now because I can feel confident and that's an unbelievable feeling. Everybody who I've spoken to has been so complimentary and kind. My head should be massive.</p><p>"People have been saying I look 20 years younger, but I've still got the brain of a 78-year-old. My body is old but my hair is young. I've not seen myself look like this for so long.</p><p>"I was nervous because it was the fear of the unknown. It felt like I was having a major operation with no anasthetic, but I just went with the flow. I couldn't imagine what it was going to turn out like.</p><p>"When I saw it I was stunned. I started touching it and I thought 'I could feel hair' and I haven't been able to do that for so long. It doesn't feel like it's not yours. I was emotional because it's astounding.</p><p>"I used to just hate [my hair] and didn't like having my picture taken. Every time I looked in the mirror I just thought, 'what am I going to do here?'. I couldn't get my head around it.</p><p>"I just let it grow and put it up with a clip that pinned my hair back and somehow camouflaged the crown of my hair. It was just receding back and back all the time and it brought my self-confidence right down.</p><p>"When I was younger I had tonnes of hair. I had the beehive hairstyle and the fashion came around three times. I had piles of dark hair. It was never curly but I had lots of thin hair."</p><p>Brian said: "It's like being married to someone 20 years younger. It's a good job I've still got plenty of hair as well.</p><p>"[The transformation] is beautiful, so I'm so pleased for her. It's spot on. You couldn't ask for anything better.</p><p>"I really got a shock when I first saw her. I found her very attractive. She's not a bad looker, you know?"</p><p>Brenda believes her hair loss is due to the immune system disorder celiac, which she was diagnosed with in 2017 but claims she's been suffering from for 20 years.</p><p>After growing fed up with her balding head, the 78-year-old asked a family friend if she knew anyone who could help, so they referred her to Rob who invited her for a consultation at his salon in Seaham, County Durham.</p><p>They decided on her bob style and then Rob hired a chair at a salon in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, to carry out the transformation and film it earlier this month.</p><p>The 'hair system' includes a stretchy ‘polyskin’ membrane attached to her head and existing hair with double-sided adhesive tape made especially for skin.</p><p>It'll last around six months and Brenda will need to have it cleaned every month by her regular hairdresser who she insists she'll still visit for her weekly appointment.</p><p>Rob, who proudly claims he's on a mission to 'rid the world of anyone hating their hair loss', says it feels great to see Brenda so happy after two decades of low self-esteem.</p><p>Rob said: "When I met her and heard she's been going around like that for 20 years, I knew she was perfect for it.</p><p>"She relied on the length as a crutch, so we wanted to give her something a little more modern. I envisaged a style that was manageable.</p><p>"She was open to any ideas, so when her character came out that's when I asked about doing the video with her.</p><p>"It made me feel good to see her so happy. It's great she's more confident going out now and the reaction has been incredible.</p><p>"It shows you're never too old to get this done. If you're not happy with your hair you need to get it down. Unfortunately with that generation they tend to put up and shut up and it's a shame."</p><p>His video, posted to his novocabelohair TikTok page, has been liked more than 100,000 times and has more than 2,000 comments.</p><p>User Khykolu commented: "Oh she looks gorgeous, and 20 years younger."</p><p>User Limblic Limbo said: "Not gonna lie, I shed a tear watching this video."</p><p>Lexis Nightwood added: "The happiness he brings to her is the best part."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>We also revealed how a&nbsp;<a href=#>woman who thought she'd never become a mum now has ten kids</a>.</p><p>And&nbsp;<a href=#>another woman was crushed after her mum told her she "didn't have the figure" to wear a minidress for a date</a>.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Balding man reveals the easy way he instantly hides receding hairline</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5BvbHFqY2eEcMPOppinZZKWuaV5xqWmsGWlpXw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./connar-franklin.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Connar Franklin</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./shay-mitchell-reveals-daughters-name-in-sweet-post.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Shay Mitchell Reveals Daughters Name in Sweet Post</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
