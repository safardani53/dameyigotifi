And the place they chose for their wedding? Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>They had previously planned to get married in June 2020, but the coronavirus pandemic upended their initial plans.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>But, despite the cancellations and disappointment, their second attempt at a wedding was as close to perfection as it could get considering the times. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The nuptials happened in a private Disney’s Fairy Tale Wedding ceremony in the Magic Kingdom at Disney World.</p><p>For the attires, Woods donned an off-shoulder Eissen Stein gown while Fisher rocked a velvet black suit with a bowtie and black leather shoes to top off the look. Of course, they also wore matching masks.</p><p>They said their “I do” in front of a small group of their loved ones, who were all masked up and socially distanced. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>They stood in the back courtyard of the Cinderella Castle and committed to one another at the stroke of midnight.</p><p>There were no traditional dinners, though. To keep everyone present safe, they just shared their first dance, cut into their multi-tier wedding cake, and drove off in a vintage car with Fisher’s song ‘Happily Ever After’ playing in the background.</p><p>The couple had to shorten the duration of the functions, but everything still ended up being just right. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Jordan Fisher and Ellie Woods’s Relationship History</h2><p>Fisher and Ellie first met in 2012. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Acting brought them together</a> — they first met at a theater camp in Alabama. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But their relationship did not take off right away. It was actually around January 2015 that they started becoming more than just friends.</p><p>Fisher confirmed they were dating in November 2017. They took a chance and it paid off.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>“I was like ‘Come to New York. I’ll take you on some dates and let’s just figure it out,” Fisher said to his now-wife. So she did, and they became a thing after a couple of dates.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>They were in a long-distance relationship at the time and only saw each other once every three weeks or so.&nbsp;He was in L.A. doing jobs and she was in Alabama completing her studies in clinical dietetics.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>However, they persevered and made it to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">their first anniversary</a>. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Then second</a>, until finally, Fisher decided on making his best friend his wife. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>On May 29, 2019, he got down on one knee and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">proposed to her</a>. She said yes. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The couple wanted to get married in Hawaii on June 24, 2020.</p><p>But, that got canceled.
