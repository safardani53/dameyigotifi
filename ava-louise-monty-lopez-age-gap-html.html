Netizens thought her account was hacked, but she later clarified it was not.&nbsp;</p><p>Louise revealed to Dexerto&nbsp;that Lopez was not the first dad she had dated and that she had ample <a href=# rel=follow>experience being a stepmom</a>. She added she would welcome Rae into her life with open arms.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“I hope we can put the past behind us as I was on Adderall during my time pining for Bryce Hall, which dramatically increased my sex drive. I am now off Adderall and turned over a new leaf,” the controversial internet personality said.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>And while she was at it, she also expressed her disapproval at the double standards between men and women who had a significantly older partner on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TikTok</a>.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>She noted that Yung Gravy was getting praised for dating a woman twice her age while she was getting hate for dating Lopez. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Netizens commented that as much as they did not agree with most of her online antics and the things she said, she made a logical point this time. “To be fair, she ain’t wrong, she’s wrong about most things, but this she ain’t wrong about,” commented a user on tiktokinsiders Instagram post.&nbsp;</p><h2>Netizens Think Ava Louise Is Being Satirical</h2><p>Netizens have also reacted to her Dexerto comments in the tiktokinsiders’ Instagram post.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>They criticized Louise for her comments. “Wtf? Is she kidding, or what? Adopting Monty’s kids? This sounds so stupid,” a user commented.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>“This is so disrespectful on a multitude of levels,” wrote another user, while a third one called her crazy and wrote, “Praying in church? Fire signs? There is something wrong with you.”</p><p>However, some users opined that the post was satirical, and that people needed to stop taking it seriously.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>“You all know ava is trolling like always, right? She may actually be with Monty, but her entire online existence is fake and satirical at this point,” commented a user.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Meanwhile, a second user wrote, “Is this satire?? It has to be because there is actually no way that she said this?!”&nbsp;But whether or not her statements were satirical, netizens only want one thing —&nbsp;a response from Rae.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJmmlnqtu9Siqp5lnaS7tcWMpaapnapirqixjKCYqWaYqbqt</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./carmen-pritchett.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Carmen Pritchett Biography, Wiki, Age, Spouse, Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./phil-hartman-daughter-today.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Where Is Phil Hartman's Daughter Today?
