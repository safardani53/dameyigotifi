The Hallmark movie has truly beautiful scenic views, and here's where you can visit them in real life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:image/webp;base64><p>All Hallmark movies bear at least three of the following qualities: heartwarming, romantic, and visually stunning. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chasing Waterfalls</a> checks off all the boxes — and suffice to say, the titular waterfalls do not disappoint. Now, fans are wondering&nbsp;where it was filmed&nbsp;so they can check out the beautiful scenery for themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, where was 'Chasing Waterfalls' filmed?</h2><p>Like many Hallmark movies, Chasing Waterfalls was filmed in Canada, a popular spot for its sweeping natural views and the rapidly expanding film industry in Vancouver. (Although Hallmark is headquartered in Kansas City, Mo.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>However, for Chasing Waterfalls, filming took place a little outside the typical filming locations and took place in Maple Ridge, British Columbia. What audiences may not know is that British Columbia is host to at least seven different national parks all with stunning views, lush greenery, and yes, waterfalls. While unconfirmed, it's more than likely filming took place in many different locations to get the perfect shot.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Filming took place in late 2020, so cast and crew members would have had to be careful about maintaining social-distancing guidelines and take coronavirus precautions before filming. Thankfully, being out in nature is slightly less risky than filming on a soundstage in a closed indoor space, so Chasing Waterfalls is perfectly suited to the current times.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is 'Chasing Waterfalls' about?</h2><p>Not only does Chasing Waterfalls take its name from the iconic TLC song of the same name, the premise is slightly different than many other Hallmark films of the same genre. According to Hallmark.com, "Photographer Amy travels to a remote lodge to find mythical waterfalls and falls for handsome guide, Mark. They adventure to find the mystic waterfall and discover their true feelings."&nbsp;</p><p>Actress Cindy Busby plays Amy, and Christopher Russell plays Mark. Cindy and Christopher have been in several other Hallmark films together, including Love in the Forecast, so you know their chemistry is going to be off the charts. Also featured in prominent roles are Cassidy Nugent as Kyra North, Akiz Aguma as the hunter, and Frank Cassini as the shopkeeper.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>As for acting with Cindy, Christopher had nothing but nice words for his co-star.</p><p>"I do 100% love working with Cindy, as some people you just click with right away," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told MediaVillage</a> about the film and said. "People mention the word chemistry, and that could be [either] male or female. It doesn't matter. It's about clicking — knowing the rhythm of the script, or the pace, and not even needing to talk about it."&nbsp;</p><p>Christopher also hinted that the title of the movie isn't just a fun song, it's a metaphor: "[Y]ou're never gonna catch [one] because it just keeps moving. The dream of doing more with your career, and it just seems out of reach like with Cindy's character, who feels she's been chasing waterfalls her whole life."</p><p>Audiences will just have to see for themselves how things turn out.</p><p>Chasing Waterfalls premieres Saturday, Mar. 20, 2021, at 9 p.m. ET on Hallmark Channel.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmrpqrXZi1or%2FIp55mr5GpsrOywKWjrGWWnrmuscM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./corey-fogelmaniss-girlfriend-list.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Corey Fogelmanis Dating Corey Fogelmanis's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./milo-ventimiglia-my-gilmore-girls-character-jess-was-a-child.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Milo Ventimiglia: My 'Gilmore Girls' Character Jess Was a 'Child'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
