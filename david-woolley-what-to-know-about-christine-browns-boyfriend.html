The first time he held me close, it felt like my soul took it’s first breath,” the <a href=#>Sister Wives</a> star, 50, wrote via Instagram on Tuesday, February 14. “He’s wonderful and kind, incredible with my children and an adorable grandpa. I never dreamed I could find a love like this. #blessed #soulmate #feelinggood #lovemylife #partner.”</p><p>Woolley, for his part, <a href=#>gushed about the new relationship in his own sweet tribute.</a></p><p>“When I’m with you, we just sit in our own little bubble and the world can go around us and we’re just standing still and it’s perfect and I have never felt like this before,” he captioned several Instagram photos with Brown. “When I took you to the The Little Mermaid play I saw how much you loved life and I knew I had some one special for me. I’m the luckiest guy, thank you for finding me. Love, your king ❤️.”</p><p>Before forming a connection with Woolley, Christine was in a public relationship with <a href=#><strong>Kody Brown</strong></a>. The couple, <a href=#>whose life was documented in the hit TLC series</a>, were spiritually married since 1994. They <a href=#>share six children together</a>: Aspyn, 27, Mykelti, 26, Paedon, 24, Gwendlyn, 21, Ysabel, 19, and Truely, 12.</p><p>In November 2021, Christine <a href=#>announced that her and Kody, 54, had called it quits.</a></p><p>“After more than 25 years together, Kody and I have grown apart and I have made the difficult decision to leave,” she wrote via Instagram at the time. “We will continue to be a strong presence in each other’s lives as we parent our beautiful children and support our wonderful family. At this time, we ask for your grace and kindness as we navigate through this stage within our family.”</p><p>The Cooking With Just Christine star later <a href=#>noted she was looking forward to the next chapter in her life</a>. “I’m like, ‘Am I being super selfish?’ I’m changing the whole dynamic of a huge family with so many people,” she explained during the Sister Wives: One on One tell-all special in February 2022. “Is it just selfish? Is that what it is? I just decided I’ve got to live my life for me too. I wasn’t present. I wasn’t happy. It just wasn’t working anymore.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the polygamist continued to face obstacles in his personal life.</p><p>After being legally married to <a href=#><strong>Meri Brown</strong></a> from 1990 to 2014, the duo <a href=#>initially stayed together before their split was announced</a> in December 2022. That same month, sister wife <a href=#><strong>Janelle Brown</strong></a> said she and Kody <a href=#>parted ways after they initially entered a spiritual marriage</a> in 1993. Kody is still together with <a href=#><strong>Robyn Brown</strong></a>, who <a href=#>he officially exchanged vows with in 2014.</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Ahead of her Valentine’s Day debut with Woolley, Christine <a href=#>hinted that she found someone special</a>, saying via Instagram Story, “Car confessions! So I just have to tell you, I am dating someone exclusively. He’s wonderful and romantic and so kind and everything I’ve been looking for. [He’s] incredible with [my and Kody’s daughter] Truely. He’s absolutely a dream come true.”</p><p>Scroll on for more to know about Christine’s new man:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksaLCyJ1ksKefobmmxYywn5qsXam8brfNqK5mmZKkwrV5wqGpoquknrumecGrprCmo2KvsMXFq6CeppRk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./logan-paul-company-prime-defends-amount-of-caffeine-in-energy-drink-after-backlash-7559130.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Logan Pauls Company PRIME Defends Caffeine in Their Energy Drink</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./8-year-old-utah-girl-dies-after-being-run-over-by-vehicle-during-performance-at-july-4th-parade.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>8-Year-Old Girl Dies After Being Run Over by Vehicle at Utah Parade</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
