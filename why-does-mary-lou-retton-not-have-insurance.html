Mary Lou was one of the <a href=#>most famous athletes</a> in America following her victory in the 1984 Olympic Games. In early October 2023, her daughter says was <a href=#>hospitalized in the ICU</a>, battling for her life against a rare form of pneumonia.</p><p>While these circumstances are devastating enough all on their own, they have been made even more tragic by the news that Mary Lou is uninsured. A crowdfunding campaign was started to raise money for her treatment, but many still wondered how a hugely successful athlete like Mary Lou could be uninsured. Here's what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why does Mary Lou Retton not have health insurance?</h2><p>In a post on the crowdfunding site <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotfund</a> where money is being raised for Mary Lou's treatment, her <a href=#>daughter McKenna Kelly</a> wrote that her mother's situation was dire. "My amazing mom, Mary Lou, has a very rare form of pneumonia and is fighting for her life. She is not able to breathe on her own. She’s been in the ICU for over a week now," the post stated.</p><p>It was unclear where Mary Lou was being treated, but she currently lives in Houston, Tex. Thankfully, the former gymnast was able to return home at the end of October. In a Nov. 23, 2023 Instagram post, Mary Lou expressed how thankful she was "to be home with [her] girls," and also mentioned that she was still slowly recovering.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Mary Lou Retton (@marylouretton)</a></p></figure><p>McKenna said that she had left the circumstances of her mother's treatment vague out of respect for her privacy, but added that her mother was uninsured.</p><p style=text-align:start>"ANYTHING, absolutely anything, would be so helpful for my family and my mom. Thank y’all so very much!" McKenna concluded. The Spotfound opened with a goal of raising $50,000, but has since raised more than $459,000 at the time of writing.</p><p>As for why Mary Lou is uninsured, the exact reasons are unclear. Mary Lou has continued to work in endorsement deals, including some for drugstore chains. It's possible, then, that Mary Lou is uninsured because while she collects fees from the work that she does as an analyst and through endorsement deals, she doesn't have health insurance through a single employer, and neglected to buy a plan herself on the open market.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>More than 3,000 donors have donated $148,405 to a campaign started by Mary Lou Retton’s daughter McKenna Kelley to pay for bills associated with her care for a rare form of pneumonia.</p><p>Her daughter says the Olympic great does not have medical insurance.</p>— Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) <a href=#>October 11, 2023</a> <span>Source: Twitter/@darrenrovell</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fans are outraged that Mary Lou Retton is uninsured.</h2><p>Whatever the exact reasons may be, many who loved Mary Lou when she competed were outraged to discover that she was uninsured.</p><p style=text-align:start>"No human in America shouldn’t have healthcare.
