Reagan nominated James Watt for Interior Secretary on December 23, 1980, in Washington. Watt and his supporters saw him as a champion of President Ronald Reagan’s basic conservative ideals. Nonetheless, his critics were concerned about his policies and offended by his words.</p><p>In 1981, shortly after Watt’s appointment, the Sierra Club collected over one million petitions demanding for his resignation. They criticized his clear-cutting of federal lands in the Pacific Northwest, low environmental safeguards for strip mining, and hindering attempts to alleviate air pollution in Yosemite Valley, California.&nbsp;Because of his bald head and huge spectacles, he became the uncommon interior secretary noticed by the general public for grounds other than looks. Stay with us until the end to learn about James Watt’s obituary and cause of death.</p><h2>James Watt Obituary And Cause Of Death</h2><p><strong>James Watt</strong>, the Reagan administration’s interior secretary, died at the age of 85. Environmentalists routinely chastised Watt for what they saw as pro-development policies like increased logging and drilling on public lands. Watt, a Wyoming native, served as Interior Secretary from 1981 until 1983, when he resigned. Watt advocated as Interior Secretary that land should be used rather than preserved for its own purpose. Furthermore, he was chastised for barring rock music from the Fourth of July festivities on the National Mall.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/James-Watt-1.jpg alt="James Watt" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Watt died on May 27 in Arizona, where he and his wife lived, according to a family statement.&nbsp;James Watt, the Reagan administration’s interior secretary, died at the age of 85. Watt’s son, Eric Watt, said on June 8 that his father died on May 27, 2023, in Arizona. In terms of James Watt’s obituary, his funeral would be attended by his family and close friends.</p><h2>A Family Mourns the Death of an American Lawyer</h2><p>Eric Watt, his son, announced his father’s death in a text message on Thursday but did not elaborate on the cause of death.&nbsp;He was the Reagan administration’s caustic and pro-development interior secretary who was revered by conservatives but battled with environmentalists and Beach Boys fans.&nbsp;On Thursday, Watt’s son, Eric Watt, issued a statement announcing his father’s death in Arizona on May 27.</p><p>Few in government were more conservative than Watt, who once described the environmental movement as “preservation vs. people” and the general public as a fight between “liberals and Americans.” Watt was a forerunner of an active Interior Secretary like Watt, who battled for oil, gas, and coal leases on public lands, boosted offshore drilling, and limited the expansion of national parks and monuments. He was the worst of MAGA before it existed, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, which referenced to former President Donald Trump’s tagline “Make America Great Again.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/James-Watt.jpg alt="James Watt" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Details About James Watt’s Career</h2><p>James returned to Wyoming in 1986, founded a law firm in Jackson, resumed teaching at his alma mater, and began working as a legal consultant and speaker.&nbsp;However, when a fraud investigation at the Department of Housing and Urban Development was launched in the late 1980s, his consulting work with federal housing monies came under fire. Watt has voiced worry over the years that extreme environmental groups such as Earth First!</p><p>If not prevented, the “cowards of Congress” would be influenced to abolish all hunting, logging, and cattle grazing on public lands, endangering the mining companies and others.&nbsp;His later years were spent in Wickenburg, Arizona, with his wife Leilani.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihmqWVqHq4rdOtqmankp7Btq3RsmShp6disaqwjKGcZpyZmnqkrdSsnGanlmKxpsDAoqOsZZWtva2tyKecnWc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./boy-6-diagnosed-cancer-growing-pains.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mom Learns 6-Year-Old Son's 'Growing Pains' Are Leg Tumors</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dick-deguerin.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Dick DeGuerin net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
