When <a href=#>The Voice</a> debuted on NBC in 2011, no one knew what to expect from yet another singing competition show. However, it quickly became a success, with <a href=#><strong>Carson Daly</strong></a> as host and a group of successful, entertaining coaches ready to find the next superstar.</p><p>Kicking off the first season, <a href=#><strong>Blake Shelton</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Christina Aguilera</strong></a>, <strong>CeeLo Green</strong> and <a href=#><strong>Adam Levine</strong></a> filled the coaches’ chairs, each bringing their different expertise to the table. Though the Maroon 5 frontman was the first to win season 1 with singer Javier Colon, the country superstar then went on to <a href=#>win the following three seasons</a> in a row with <strong>Jermaine Paul</strong>, <strong>Cassadee Pope</strong> and <strong>Danielle Bradbery</strong>. Each winner was awarded $100,000 and a record deal with Universal Music Group.</p><p>Aguilera and Green both took season 4 off and were temporarily replaced by <a href=#><strong>Shakira</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Usher</strong></a>. The original judges returned for their chairs in season 5 before leaving again in season 6.</p><p>The “Genie in a Bottle” singer briefly appeared as a part-time adviser on season 7 before returning as a coach twice more — for seasons 8 and 10, officially exiting in 2016 and later referring to the show as an “energy sucker” in her life.</p><p>“It became something that I didn’t feel was what I had signed up for in season 1. … You realize it’s not about music. It’s about making good TV moments and massaging a story,” she <a href=#>told Billboard magazine</a> in 2018. “I didn’t get into this business to be a television show host and to be given all these [rules]. … Especially as a female: ‘You can’t wear this, can’t say that.’ I would find myself on that show desperately trying to express myself through clothing or makeup or hair. It was my only kind of outlet.”</p><p>Fans were shocked at her admission. Through the years, multiple other coaches have come and gone, but only one other had a similar impact. At the end of season 16, Levine <a href=#>announced that he would not</a> be returning <a href=#>following a suspicious performance</a> with the other judges at an Upfront presentation in New York City. At the time, he appeared lackadaisical, something both press and advertisers noticed.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In a 2019 Instagram post, he hinted that there was no bad blood, adding he would “<a href=#>be back to say hi very very soon</a>.” However, in 2020,<a href=#> he wrote “no thank you”</a> when a fan asked whether he’d return.</p><p>Scroll through the gallery below for all the coaches through the years and why they left the show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BptaZ51aignJ1dmLyir8eeqmasmKe8trPHZquhnV2usqK%2B0mauoaddobKnwIywn7Jn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./liz-cho-bio-age-ethnicity-jewish-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Liz Cho Father Inspired Her To Be A Best Journalist?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-isabela-rangel-grutman-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Isabela Rangel Grutman Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
