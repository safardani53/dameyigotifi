Grace’s story in the movie is based on her own life experiences. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Grace, a tomboyish character, loses her brother, Johnny, in a traffic accident. This is similar to Shue’s loss of her brother, William, during a freak accident.</p><p>The heart of the movie is the pain that William’s passing gave her, with whom she was really close.</p><p>She has said that his death “changed our [sic] lives” and was one of the “most painful gifts” she had gotten. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Her husband knows how the incident changed her. In 1988, Guggenheim revealed the lessons Shue received from the tragedy.</p><p>“I don’t think you can continue after that and live on the surface,” he said, talking about how Shue realized the “wonderful, horrible duality” to life.</p><p>He also saw how it affected her acting. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“What it means is that she can suddenly, as an actress, dig a whole lot deeper,” he added. As an example of her growth in her trade, he alluded to her performance in Leaving Las Vegas. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Guggenheim also influenced her to become a better actress. An Oscar-winning documentarian himself, his way of making her realize her potential was a little untraditional, so to speak.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>He basically loved her into being better.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>While speaking to Interview magazine in 1996 (<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">via Talent Develop</a>), she revealed her husband’s methods.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>“He made me feel loved the way Will had loved me,” the actress said, talking about how Guggenheim knew about her fear and reluctance to become a great actress.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>“I was afraid to want it for fear that it would never happen, and he challenged me and encouraged me to start studying and growing as an actor,” she said.</p><p>That changed her trajectory in the industry, which primarily knew her for her “good girl” roles in light-hearted movies. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After that, she came to terms with her own potential. “I wasn’t afraid anymore,” Shue admitted.</p><h2>Elisabeth Shue and Husband’s Family</h2><p>Shue married Guggenheim, who she has called “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">the greatest love</a>” of her life, in August 1994.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>They <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">have three kids</a> — Miles William, Stella Street, and Agnes Charles. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The children are all grown up now.

There's not much available about her marriage and children.</p><p>Stella seems to be artistically motivated, just like her parents. Her Instagram is filled with sketches, drawings, and photographs of various sorts.</p><p>Agnes, too, is on Instagram, but her account is set to private.
