is the meaning of the Chlo<strong>ë</strong> Grace Moretz Family Guy meme?</h2><p>On May 23, 2016, <a href=#>Chloë Grace Moretz</a> was photographed on her way back to her <a href=#>New York City</a> hotel.</p><p>Since then, online users have taken those images of <a href=#>Chloë</a> and photoshopped her body.</p><p>The manipulated images make it appear as if <a href=#>Chloë's</a> legs are longer than they actually are and that her torso is smaller than it is in reality.</p><p>The edited pictures of the actress caused Instagram, Twitter, and Reddit users to draw similarities between <a href=#>Chloë and Legs Go All the Way Up Griffin</a> from the <a href=#>FOX</a> cartoon <a href=#>Family Guy</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Chloë">Read More on Chloë</h2><p>In the <a href=#>Family Guy</a> gag that didn't reference <a href=#>Chloë</a> in the first place, <a href=#>Peter Griffin</a> remembers his great aunt and recalls how her legs went all the way up to her neck with no torso visible.</p><p>The comedic cutaway scene was originally featured in the episode titled Amish Guy, which was first aired on November 27, 2011.</p><h2>How did Chloë respond?</h2><p>Years later after the Internet memes in her likeness first became widespread, Chloë shared her feelings about the ordeal.</p><p><a href=#>The Addams Family</a> actress told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HUNGER</a>: "For a long time I was able to be the Chloë that people see and the Chloë that I am in private.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">most read on internet memes</h2></p><p>"Then those two worlds collided and I felt really raw and vulnerable and open.</p><p>"Then came the onslaught of horrific memes that started getting sent to me about my body."</p><p>The star further shared: "I’ve actually never really talked about this, but there was one meme that really affected me, of me walking into a hotel with a pizza box in my hand.</p><p>"This photo got manipulated into a character from&nbsp;Family Guy&nbsp;with the long legs and the short torso, and it was one of the most widespread memes at the time.</p><img

someone and they were like, ‘Oh, shut the f**k up, it’s funny.’"</p><p>She added: "I just remember sitting there and thinking, my body is being used as a joke and it’s something that I can’t change about who I am, and it is being posted all over Instagram.</p><p>"It was something so benign as walking into a hotel with leftovers.</p><p>"To this day, when I see that meme, it’s something very hard for me to overcome."</p><p>"I think that body dysmorphia, which we all deal with in this world, is extrapolated by the issues of social media. It’s a headf**k," said the <a href=#>People's Choice Award</a> winner.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"I basically became a recluse. It was great because I got away from the photographers and I was able to be myself and to have so many experiences that people didn’t photograph.</p><p>"At the same time, it made me severely anxious when I was photographed."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huY2eAdICQaJqhpJ%2Baeqi%2BwJycZqWfp7K1xoyfmKahnK56qMHYZqSepZVk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./coin-collector-lincoln-penny-bonus-column-valuable.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Im a coin collector - your Lincoln penny could be worth up to $2,900, look for the 'bonus' column</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./meet-actress-andra-day-explore-her-love-life.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Andra Day and is she married?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
