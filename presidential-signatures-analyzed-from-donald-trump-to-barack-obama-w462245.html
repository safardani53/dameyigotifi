where the t’s are crossed and the i’s dotted; lower loops, upper loops, individual letters, how those letters connect to each other and far more than can be written here.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/632182820_donald-trump-barack-obama-zoom-8e9e88f8-0021-4d19-8e9c-de935d1b1bc8.jpg><p>In looking at Trump’s signature, McKnight noted that “graphologists have long taken interest in Trump’s signature because it is so unique.” According to her, “the razor sharp writing, full of points and wedges, reveals someone whose mind is extremely analytical.”</p><span class=caption></span><p>Furthermore, McKnight said that the lack of space between his first and last name indicates that “what ‘Trump’ represents is equally important to him as his personal self.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/632188202_george-w-bush-zoom-18a3e87e-c224-4066-a939-2ce4b85dbfeb.jpg><p>So how does Trump’s signature compare to presidents before him? McKnight told <i>Us</i> that former president Obama’s signature similarly has no space between his first and last name, which she says signals an emphasis on family. “His family (last) name is as important to him as his individual, personal self (first name),” she said. “They are one unit. This signature has threaded writing-meaning the writing is written so fast it resembles a loose piece of thread that has come unravelled. This reveals one who can see the end result of a problem or issue so fast that his mind works lightening fast to get there. His brain is working faster than the pen can keep up.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Signatures of last four Presidents: Trump, Obama, George W. Bush & Clinton <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/rku4PPda6K</a></p><p>— Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) <a href=#>January 20, 2017</a></p><p>Two additional presidents’ signatures also underwent analysis: <b>George W. Bush</b>‘s and <b>Bill Clinton</b>‘s. Of Bush, McKnight said, “The signature is illegible, so you will not know the real him unless he invites you in to do so. The long lower loop in the letter ‘g’ in George reveals tremendous drive and ambition. The ending stroke to his last name trails off at nearly a 45 degree angle, which reveals the philosophy of one who believes there are no problems, just solutions. The way many letters are missing reveals great secretiveness.”</p><p>Clinton’s signature, on the other hand, “is pretty easy to read,” said McKnight. “The ‘i’ dots are planted where they should be, above the ‘i’ revealing a level of attention to detail; not flung off to the far left or right. In his first name, the first letter, B, is quite large revealing a healthy ego, which frankly is needed to stand out in the world of politics,” she said. “The rest of the letters are all in the same middle zone divulging he is living day to day.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapqpWotqWxza2gmqRdqLaousCtrKudo2Kur63LsrGenF2bv7C5jJ2mp5mcmXq1vtSmp2asn2Kvor7AnKJmp5KWuqJ51m1ta2pkanw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./robby-takac-19640930-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Robby Takac (Bassist) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./owain-yeoman.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Owain Yeoman</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
