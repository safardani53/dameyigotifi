While she dipped her toe in Hollywood, working in the casting department for the 1991 film Separate But Equal, Beverly has mostly stayed away from the spotlight. However, she has a few credits as a video producer, as well. She also has her own line of jewelry she sells on Etsy and self-published her own book in 2001 called Nana.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“Nana&nbsp;is my first novel and I really enjoyed writing it. It was extremely fast because the characters just seemed to take over,” Beverly told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vidette Online</a>. “The idea came from a lot of places – from a little old lady I knew at church, members of my family and things like that.”</p><h3><span><span><b><i><strong>Pamela Poitier</strong></i></b></span></span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/pamela-with-sidney-poitier-shutterstock-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Pamela, born on April 12, 1954, decided to follow in her father’s footsteps as an actor.

There, she created the documentary Islands of Life, which brought awareness to the preservation of the ecological diversity of the Bahamas.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Pamela also set up a school to teach acting on the island as well. “I decided to teach these classes to share my knowledge of Strasberg’s acting method that I learned from <strong>Lee Strasberg</strong> himself and then was asked by him to teach in his school in New York City,” Beverly told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Tribune</a> in 2013. “I believe that there are many more talented people in the Bahamas like my father.”</p><h3><span><span><b><i><strong>Sherri Poitier</strong></i></b></span></span></h3><p id=content-paragraph-8>Born on July 12, 1956, Sherri also got the acting bug early on.

After her acting career stalled, Sherri took a break from the spotlight and now keeps relatively private. More recently, Sherri has dabbled in the culinary arts as a cook, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Sun</a>.</p><h3><span><span><b><i><strong>Gina Poitier</strong></i></b></span></span></h3><p id=content-paragraph-9>Gina graduated from the State University of New York in Albany and also earned a degree in Fashion Merchandise from the American College of Applied Arts in Atlanta.

Sydney is married to <strong>Dorian Heartsong</strong>, and they share one son.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Sydney once revealed her favorite movie by her father was To Sir, With Love. “He played this empowering teacher, and I just remember feeling super proud that he was my dad,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Hollywood Reporter</a> in 2013. “The world knows him as this iconic, legendary, historical figure. But he’s also just a really, really good dad,” she added.</p><h3><span><span><b><i><strong>Anika Poitier</strong></i></b></span></span></h3><p id=content-paragraph-12>Anika was born on February 29, 1972 in Manhattan.
