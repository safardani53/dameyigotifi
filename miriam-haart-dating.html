The family has shared many moments in their lives, including personal and professional highs and lows.</p><p>One significant low for the family was Julia and Silvio’s 2022 divorce after just three years of marriage. The fallout from their split will be a large part of the show’s second season. The season will also explore how <a href=#>Julia’s children</a> — Batsheva (29), Shlomo (26), Miriam (22), and Aron Hendler (15) — are also handling the divorce.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While the kids will address the breakup, they'll also share changes in their own lives. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miriam</a>, for instance, has been on the dating scene but is ready to reveal the person who took her off the market. So, who is Miriam Haart dating? Keep reading to find out!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Miriam Haart dating anyone? She opened up about her relationship on ‘My Unorthodox Life.’</h2><p>Since fans met Miriam in Season 1 of My Unorthodox Life, she has been candid about living her life differently than her religious elders. In earlier episodes, Miriam stated she was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">openly bisexual</a> — a brave reveal for a young Jewish woman — though fans never saw her dating anyone on the show. However, the Stanford graduate has since decided to be even more open about her personal life in time for the new season.</p><p>While visiting Paris, France, in July 2021, Miriam posted several snaps with her girlfriend, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nathalie Ulander</a>. Nathalie is a former tennis player from Sweden who moved to the U.S. after graduating from Stockholm Idrottsgymnasium.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>When Nathalie moved to the U.S., she originally called Texas her home. In 2018, she attended <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tarleton State University</a> outside of Dallas/Fort Worth, and played tennis for the school until her sophomore year. Nathalie graduated from the program in June 2022.</p><p>After Nathalie completed her program, she moved to New York, where she currently resides. In the summer of 2021, she met Miriam on a dating app. On My Unorthodox Life, Miriam explained that she was initially “looking for sex” before she met Nathalie, but ended up falling “in love” with the athlete.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Are Miriam and Nathalie still together?</h2><p>Since Miriam and Nathalie first went Instagram official, they continued flooding their accounts with photos and videos of their moments together. In March 2022, Miriam <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a video</a> surprising Nathalie with a romantic suite for them to enjoy. She then captioned the post with “always flying with you.”</p><p>While Miriam’s gesture was incredibly thoughtful, it was one of the last timeline posts of her and Nathalie. In April 2022, Miriam published <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">another post</a> of the couple hanging out in NYC, but she hasn’t shared anything else on her grid since then.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Instead, Miriam’s recent posts have been about her show, her family and friends, and her podcast, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Faking It</a>. Her lack of Nathalie-themed content has made some fans worry that the couple broke up sometime in 2022. However, that might not be the case.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>In November 2022, Nathalie revealed that My Unorthodox Life Season 2 would feature her and Miriam’s relationship. Then on Dec. 2, Nathalie posted photos from the <a href=#>NYC premiere party</a>, which she attended with Miriam’s family. Though the couple seemingly kept their distance in Nathalie’s first picture, a later photo shows them happily posing together.</p><p>Of course, this doesn’t necessarily mean they're still together. We'll just have to tune into My Unorthodox Life to watch their relationship play out.</p><p>Season 2 of My Unorthodox Life is currently streaming Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforaztcCmZKGZkafBbrDAraCnnw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./beautiful-memory-of-messi-and-ronaldo-rivalry.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Beautiful Memory Of Messi And Ronaldo Rivalry</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kim-kardashian-responds-to-nicki-minajs-break-the-internet-paper-cover.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kim Kardashian Responds to Nicki Minaj's 'Break the Internet' 'Paper' Cover</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
