I wish everyone in this situation all the best, including myself which is why I’m her to share the truth so I can officially be done with all of this.

It had nothing to do with anything else. It had nothing to do with anybody else, for that matter. And we just didn’t work out, and that’s OK,'” he wrote on social media.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Later in the vlog, Alix said that Sophia eventually reached out to her, and apologized. She said that they seemed to make up, but later Sophia appeared on another podcast and spoke about the cheating claims, which infuriated the social media star. “When I heard this I actually almost broke my phone in half because it was like, ‘I clearly said no, that did not happen and here you go again,'” Alix said. “At least give me the respect of having a conversation with me about it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ze5FyZpqkma16pq3RpZxmrJGhuLR5wauYsayfo3qjsdGroKirXZa7pXnSqKehoZFisLa4z6hkq52clsGqu82sn6KoXZm%2FornAaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dua-lipa-barbie-movie-cameo.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dua Lipa appears in Barbie for a matter of seconds alongside Love Island star</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./california-woman-dies-after-trying-to-save-friend-stuck-in-snow-family-says.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Woman Dies Trying to Help Free Someone from California Snowstorm</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
