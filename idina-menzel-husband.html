Here's what you need to know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Actress and Broadway star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Idina Menzel</a> has a long career in film, television, and onstage. After launching her career at 24 by starring in the wildly successful rock musical RENT, she began releasing solo musical albums and starring in smaller parts until 2003, when she originated the role of Elphaba in Wicked. Since then, Idina's career has only continued to soar to new heights, but what about her personal life?</p><p>The Disenchanted actress has kept her personal life relatively private on social media, so inquiring fans want to know more. Keep reading for the scoop on Idina Menzel's love life, including her <a href=#>husband</a>, how many kids she has, and more!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Idina Menzel's husband?</h2><p>Idina met her first husband, actor Taye Diggs, when they were both performing as original cast members in RENT in 1995. The duo eventually started dating and tied the knot in 2003. Idina and Taye reprised their Broadway roles in the 2005 film RENT alongside fellow original cast members Adam Pascal, Anthony Rapp, Jesse L. Martin, and Wilson Jermaine Heredia.</p><p>Sadly, despite a decade of marital bliss, news broke in 2013 that Taye and Idina had filed for divorce. In a joint statement to <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, the former couple wrote, "Idina Menzel and Taye Diggs have jointly decided to separate at this time. Their primary focus and concern is for their son. We ask that you respect their privacy during this time."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Following her divorce, Idina began dating fellow actor Aaron Lohr in 2015. Ironically, Aaron also appeared in a brief role in the 2005 film adaptation of RENT, where the two first met. Although it is unclear how they reconnected, Aaron and Idina made their first public appearance as a couple at the April 2015 White House Correspondent's Association dinner, per <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo! Entertainment</a>.</p><p>By August, <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">The Los Angeles Times</a> reported they had purchased a home worth an estimated $2.675 million, and by 2016, Idina announced she was engaged on Twitter. Idina and Aaron officially married in September 2017 and have been together ever since! Yahoo! Entertainment says Aaron has since retired from acting and currently serves as the clinical director at Avalon Malibu, a mental health and addiction rehab center.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Idina Menzel have any kids?</h2><p>Idina has only one child, a son named Walker. She welcomed him in 2009 <a href=# style=text-align:start>with now-ex Taye Diggs</a>. She and Taye have frequently spoken about their co-parenting tactics and how they navigate divorce amicably. In an <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with the radio show</a> Valentine in the Morning, Idina talked about dating after divorce and wanting to put Walker's feelings first after her own experience as a child.</p><p>Idina said, "I don't want to keep introducing him to people and having him form bonds and then take them away, you know? It's bad enough his mom and dad are getting divorced."</p><p>"I went through it when I was 15 years old. I keep telling myself, because I feel so badly for him, it's better that he's 4-and-a half than when he's 15. He has two parents that love him very much and we want to be great moms and dads," Idina added. "At 15 I was too aware; I thought I was an adult, and I got in the middle of everything, and I took on the stress for both of them."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Thankfully, it sounds like she and Taye are navigating co-parenting well, and her new husband Aaron adores Walker! "They’re very close,” Idina told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> in 2017. “They’re probably watching a film, or they run around play dodgeball with a sock, they make a ball out of socks and they hit each other."</p><p>Catch Idina's next project, a sequel to 2007's Enchanted, titled Disenchanted, exclusively on Disney Plus own Nov. 18, 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnrGqusBmpJ6mqpq5brTUrJmappQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./good-instagram-bios.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>50 Solid Instagram Bio Ideas to Spice Up Your Online Persona and Gain Followers</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-elizabeth-gutierrez-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Elizabeth Gutierrez Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
