Pop-up ones are definitely easier to build, often having a similar opening and closing system to an umbrella.</p><p>We recommend starting by building the (often steel) frames for the roof first, then moving onto the legs, which often extend with a knob or screw.</p><p>Then, place the roof on top of the legs and extend all the legs, with the roof in place, to your most suitable height.</p><h2>How to secure a gazebo from wind</h2><p>Most gazebos come with weight bags, ropes or stakes to keep them strong and secure in windy conditions. Make sure to do this, as the brand is unlikely to refund you if it blows away after being badly secured.</p><p>Often, gazebo legs have 'feet' with holes in to secure a stake through. Ropes hook from the stakes, up through the fabric covers and to the roof, keeping even the walls in place.</p><p>We recommend putting your gazebo on flat, sturdy ground that won't flood and sink.</p><h2>Do I need planning permission for a gazebo?</h2><p>Generally, you don't need planning permission for a gazebo in the UK, if it's temporary (often erected for less than a month) and no larger than around 2-2.5m in height.</p><p>You aren't allowed to erect a gazebo at the front of your house according to your Permitted Development Rights - so it'll have to be in your back garden or yard.</p><p>However, if you live in a protected area, or are planning to build a large gazebo structure that is heavy-duty, you will likely need planning permission from your local council.</p><p>If you're unsure, we would recommend getting in touch with your local council representative.</p><h2>Is a gazebo worth it?</h2><p>A gazebo is a good investment if you want to spend time in the garden come rain or shine, and a well-made one can last for years.</p><p>If you're prone to sunburn or don't like the heat, it'll provide you with shade. And if the weather turns, some will also protect you from the rain.</p><p>Plus, if you get one with mesh sides, you can dine al fresco without worrying about pesky bugs interrupting.</p><p>Just bear in mind that you'll need to have a fair bit of space in your garden and somewhere to store it when not in use.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqysp2Wjmrmmr9OsZmppZmh9eIKUaJmeq6RitKLGxJumrGc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ariana-fletcher-message-g-herbo-son-taina-williams-feud.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ariana Fletcher Posts Message To G-Herbo About GF Taina Williams Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./trash-bags-inside-out-using-wrong.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Youve Been Using Your Trash Bags Wrong Your Entire Life, According to This Viral TikTok</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
