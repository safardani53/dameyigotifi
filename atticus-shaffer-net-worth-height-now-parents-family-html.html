He was born with a congenital condition, termed osteogenesis imperfecta, commonly known as brittle bones disease. The situation meant that his bones would not usually form and as a result, he would have a short stature. The worse part of the disease would be a supposed inability to walk -&nbsp;which was what the doctors had told his family.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The actor opened up about his illness to Pure Talk in June 2018&nbsp;that he was grateful for his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">mother</a> who refused to entertain the fact that her son could not walk and raised him up as a normal kid. As a result, he grew up to a height of 4 feet and 8 inches and could still walk.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>He also revealed that&nbsp;he had turned to god at a young age. Being born with a painful condition meant that he required regular surgeries and had to go through a lot of pain which is when he resorted towards god. And turning to god not only made him relieve his pain and suffering, but it also made him compassionate and empathic.&nbsp;</p><p>The actor also spoke of his pride in having represented differently-abled people and claimed that his onscreen character was a role model to him along with other millions of viewers.

The actor took to his own Youtube channel to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">address</a> questions from his fans, particularly regarding his views on dating and marriage.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>In the video, Atticus stressed that the best way in honoring god was to&nbsp;save&nbsp;himself for his future wife.&nbsp;He strongly emphasized his Christian faith for his beliefs about marriage and dating. He believed that god had preordained a wife for him and that he would be waiting for her.&nbsp;</p><p>His views on dating were also rather unorthodox in comparison with the modern world.
