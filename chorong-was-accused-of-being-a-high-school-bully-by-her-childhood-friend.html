Following much attention, the situation seems to have been settled, with the two sides reaching an amicable agreement.</p><h2>“Kim,” said Chorong, a high school bully in April 2021.</h2><p>IST Entertainment, the idol’s agency, said in April 2021 that they would pursue legal action against Chorong’s “friend” Kim. Kim reportedly contacted the Apink member and threatened to disclose purported fake reports of high school violence, according to the agency’s statement. The agency then claimed that the “friend’s” purpose was to force Chorong to leave the entertainment profession.</p><p>Not long after the event, Apink’s agency filed a first criminal complaint against Kim at Gangnam Police Station through Wonil Law Firm for defamation by asserting false information and attempted coercion on April 1. IST Entertainment released an update on the legal proceedings in November 2021, noting that “Kim” was found guilty on counts of making threats of false information and that the matter was being referred to the prosecution. After the two misunderstandings have been settled, it seems that the legal war has come to an end.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Chorong-2.jpg alt=Chorong width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>The agency of Apink member Chorong issues an official statement.</h2><p>Chorong’s agency issued an official statement on March 28th, proclaiming the conclusion of the lengthy legal struggle.&nbsp;The agency began by noting that all parties concerned had decided to abandon their respective litigation.&nbsp;We are informing you that Park Chorong and “A” have resolved all of their misunderstandings regarding the series of issues that have been causing concern since last year, and they have agreed to drop all of the lawsuits that they had filed against each other during that time, so they are currently in the process of dropping all of the accusations. They went on to say that the Apink member and her companion had a private talk, putting all misconceptions to rest.</p><p dir=ltr lang=ko>[<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#에이핑크</a>]<br>[에이핑크 박초롱 고소 취하 관련 안내]</p><p>▶ <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/V5kGtqj7kh</a><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#Apink</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/plJf5RpSwf</a></p><p>— Apink(에이핑크) (@Apink_2011) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">March 28, 2022</a></p><p>Recently, the two persons met individually, excluding everyone else, and they had a meaningful time listening to each other’s tales.<br>They continued, saying:</p><p>“Through their encounter, which took place for the first time in 13 years, the two opened up about their disappointments and the unpleasant emotions they had for one another, conducting a very candid talk.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Chorong-3.jpg alt=Chorong width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>They went on:</p><p>“After the serious talk, the two settled all of their misconceptions for one another, and they decided to put a stop to all of their quarreling and war of attrition, which had been very tough.

Meanwhile, Apink members Chorong, Bomi, and Namjoo all tested positive for the virus only a day after Eunji and Hayoung did.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiaoaeipLuoedaaqmaZk5jCtLHDZqafZZKatq%2BzjJpkoaGXnXq0r8eopqVlkqq5rcWMm7BmoJWneqS0yKWboaefmXqnvsiepZ1n</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cleetus-mcfarland.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Cleetus McFarland net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./trevor-wilson-3.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Trevor Wilson (basketball)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
