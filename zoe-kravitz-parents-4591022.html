Her mother is actress <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lisa Bonet </strong></a>and her father is legendary musician <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lenny Kravitz</strong></a>. Zoë was born in 1988, five years before her famous parents split up. Since then, Zoë has followed in both Lisa and Lenny’s footsteps. She’s released music, including her albums Calm Down&nbsp;and&nbsp;Tenderness, and has become a big-time actress thanks to her roles in&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Big Little Lies</a>,&nbsp;Mad Max: Fury Road,&nbsp;High Fidelity, and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Batman</a>, starring as Selina Kyle/Catwoman. As Zoë’s career continues to blossom, she’s maintained close relationships with her parents — who are still on great terms, too!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Zoe-Kravitzs-Parents-shutter-embed-1.jpg><h2>Lisa Bonet</h2><p id=content-paragraph-3>Lisa is an actress best known for playing Denise Huxtable on&nbsp;The Cosby Show&nbsp;and its spinoff,&nbsp;A Different World. When she turned 20 on November 16, 1987, Lisa eloped with Lenny in Las Vegas. They welcomed Zoë the following year, and enjoyed time together as a happy family of three, before divorcing in 1993. Lisa started dating actor <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jason Momoa</strong></a>&nbsp;in 2005, and they had <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>two kids together</a>. Their daughter, <strong>Lola,</strong>&nbsp;was born in 2007, followed by son <strong>Nakoa-Wolf</strong> in 2008. After several years together, the lovebirds finally tied the knot in October 2017. However, they decided to split in 2022.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Lisa has still maintained a loving relationship with her ex-husband. The couple frequently attend Hollywood events together to support one another, as well as their daughter. The exes even spend Thanksgivings together! “It’s fantastic. It’s full-on family love,” Lisa told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PorterEdit</a> in 2018. Thanks to his former marriage with Lisa, Jason also has very close bonds with Lenny and Zoë. In November 2020, the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Aquaman&nbsp;actor</a> gushed over Zoë&nbsp;and Lenny to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Men’s Health</a>, and said that he hopes his own daughter turns out just like Zoë. “I love her dad. I hope and pray my daughter is that talented and loving and open and close to her family,” Jason told the publication.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Zoe-Kravitzs-Parents-shutter-embed-2.jpg><h2>Lenny Kravitz</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Lenny is a famed singer-songwriter, record producer, and musician, whose most notable songs include “It Ain’t Over ’til It’s Over,” “Again,” “Let Love Rule,” “Fly Away,” and “Are You Gonna Go My Way.” He’s been nominated for nine Grammy Awards and won four. Lenny has also dabbled in acting projects like the Hunger Games franchise movies, Precious,&nbsp;The Butler and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Shotgun Wedding</a>. On the small screen, he’s had guest appearances on&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Simpsons</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entourage</a>, and&nbsp;Better Things. As mentioned before, Lenny and Lisa eloped in 1987, when the singer was 23 years old. Their daughter Zoë was born in 1988, and the couple got divorced a few years later. Lenny has not gotten remarried, but he was in relationships with models <strong>Vanessa Paradis</strong> and <strong>Adriana Lima</strong>, and then was briefly engaged to <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Nicole Kidman</strong></a> in the mid-2000s.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Over the years, Lenny has kept up such a wonderful relationship with Zoë, as well as his ex-wife. In October 2020, he told&nbsp;<i><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Tonight</a>&nbsp;</i>that there’s “no explanation” for the bond he and Lisa share post-divorce. “We experienced a very deep love that still carries on to this day, just in a different way,” Lenny explained. The “American Woman” crooner also has <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>an epic bromance with Jason</a>, which he talked about to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Men’s Health</a>&nbsp;in 2020. “People can’t believe how tight Jason and I are, or how tight I still am with Zoë’s mom, how we all relate,” Lenny shared. “We just do it because that’s what you do. You let love rule, right? I mean, obviously, after a breakup, it’s work—it takes some work and time, healing and reflection, etc. But as far as Jason and I? Literally the moment we met, we were like, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>‘Oh, yeah. I love this dude</a>.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9monGajopbDqsDZZqeaqpWjwbR5k25wamhiZ3w%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./elizabeth-chan.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Elizabeth Chan net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./christina-applegate-1st-public-outing-since-ms-diagnosis.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Christina Applegate, 1st Public Outing Since MS Diagnosis</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
