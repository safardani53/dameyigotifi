There's all the shots and so many emotions that are involved with it, and I told her that I understood the risks, and that I had been praying about it for three weeks," Smith, who is mom to eight children, told the outlet. "Then she told me, 'I was just sitting here thinking about who could I have carry my embryos, and you called me up.' "</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On May 17, Smith gave birth to Alayna Kait Chalise Munoz at American Fork Hospital before 9 p.m. "She was seven pounds, 13 ounces, 21 inches long, and came out just healthy and gave her little screams," Smith told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Fox 13</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Munoz described it as "an amazing experience" in a sentimental Instagram post.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>RELATED VIDEO: <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Nick Jonas</a> and Priyanka Chopra Welcome First Baby Via Surrogate</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I am at a loss of words," she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>wrote</a> alongside a set of touching photos of her mother resting in the hospital bed. She added pictures of her and her husband Miguel holding with the infant.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Continued Munoz: "My mom is a living angel and brought us another blessing earth side and we are in LOVE. When my mom offered to be our surrogate it just felt so right. My mom did so amazing through out the pregnancy and we had an amazing delivery experience. Grateful for my mom and her selflessness in this journey."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Smith opened up about her decision as she celebrated Alayna turning one week old last month.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Alayna is one week! As I have reflected on my surrogacy journey this past week, I have been reminded of many things I experienced along the way. Many emotions and feelings played a role in the journey. Excitement, fear, faith, hope, anticipation, doubt, joy and undoubtedly LOVE," she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>wrote</a> on Facebook last month, sharing photos from her maternity shoot.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for</strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow><strong> PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</strong></a><strong> to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She said that she initially contemplated whether she should carry the embryos, wanting to "make sure I wasn't making an emotional choice." Smith then prayed before telling Munoz her decision.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Never did I think I would experience something like this or have a baby at 50!" she wrote.
