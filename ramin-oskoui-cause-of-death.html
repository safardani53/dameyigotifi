During those appearances, Dr. Oskoui suggested that the CDC had failed in its role. He said that we didn't need a vaccine in order to return to normal.</p><p>Those opinions ran contrary to much of the conventional wisdom at the time, and some of his opinions are still controversial. Even so, Laura Ingraham expressed gratitude in her tribute for what she described as his "bravery" in being willing to share those thoughts with her and all of her viewers.</p><p>Dr. Oskoui hadn't been on the show in the past few years, in part because the pandemic faded from the headlines, but she still wanted to honor his contributions.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Dr. Ramin Oskoui worked as a cardiologist in Washington, D.C.</h2><p>Although his contributions to The Ingraham Angle focused on the pandemic, Dr. Oskoui's actual work as a doctor was focused on cardiology.
