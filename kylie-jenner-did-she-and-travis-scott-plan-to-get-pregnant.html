It wasn’t her fault that it was super bad, the infamy of that ad still haunts her brand.&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately for her, we guess that Rob and Kylie both decided to make way, way worse decisions. Rob’s revenge porn attack on Blac Chyna&nbsp;went over as well as you can imagine, and is <a href=#>costing him dearly</a>.</p><p>For her part, Kylie Jenner got pregnant at 19 years old.</p><p>And her baby daddy is rapper Travis Scott … whom she couldn’t have been dating for more than, what? A month when she got pregnant?</p><p>And he was her rebound guy after she spent a couple of years wrapped around Tyga’s finger.</p><p>Kylie loves babies, we’re sure, but being an aunt who visits babies as a teenager is nothing like actually being a parent.</p><p>Kylie’s great with her dogs which is a good sign that she probably has some decent maternal instincts, but there’s basically no way that she — or anyone her age — is truly ready to become a parent.</p><p>If you look at all of that, Kendall accepting a well-paying modeling gig from a major brand that happened to be absurdly tone-deaf doesn’t sound half-bad, does it?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>There has been some speculation that Kylie might have deliberately gotten pregnant.</p><p>Past reports had indicated that she’d talk about the idea of having a baby when things with Tyga were really good.</p><p>Well, there’s good news on that front — Us Weekly reports that <a href=#>Kylie Jenner didn’t set out to get pregnant as a teenager</a>. It just happened.</p><p>"It definitely wasn’t planned."</p><p>According to their report, Kylie weighed her options, including asking her momager and big sister Kim Kardashian for advice on what to do.</p><p>(We’re guessing that she didn’t ask Perez Hilton, though that didn’t stop him from declaring his unsolicited opinion that she "<a href=#>should have gotten an abortion</a>")</p><p>If anyone’s going to become a mom at 20, though, it should be someone who lives a block away from most of her close family.</p><p>And someone who also has virtually unlimited resources and no other obligations — like, say, school or a job or both, like your average 20-year-old — that would constantly take them away from their baby.</p><p>Apparently, these were factors that went into Kylie’s decision to go ahead and have a baby despite the surprise nature of it all.</p><p>Us also revealed what their sources say about Travis Scott and how, in light of Kylie’s news, the family views him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Apparently "the family loves him," which is not the reception that most people would get if a 24-year-old rebound guy knocked up a teenager.</p><p>(Travis was 24 at the time; he’s now 25 and Kylie is 20)</p><p>Travis Scott is reportedly "thrilled to become a dad," which lends credence to <a href=#>Travis Scott’s vague tweet</a> from this summer actually being about Kylie’s pregnancy.</p><p>Like anyone wondering if they should become a mother, you know that some fathers end up being deadbeats, so it’s important to be sure that you can do this on your own, if necessary.</p><p>(That’s not a knock against Travis Scott — seriously, anyone, but especially someone with a recent boyfriend, finding out that they’re pregnant needs to plan for the worst)</p><p>So Kylie "had to decide if she was prepared, with or without his involvement."</p><p>It looks like she figured that she could handle it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Ultimately, it was Kylie’s confidence in her family that drove her decision, Us reports.</p><p>In part because of that support network and how close she lives to her relatives.</p><p>But also because of how she’s seen the lives of her siblings improve.</p><p>"Kylie’s take is that for everyone in her family, children have only made their lives better."</p><p>You know, with even baby Dream being clearly the best thing that Rob Kardashian has ever done, that’s difficult to dispute.</p><p>We can’t imagine becoming parents so young, but considering what she’s seen from her family, we get where Kylie was coming from.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Kim, Khloe and Kylie: All the Intel on ALL the Babies!</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2Z9cLfYpaCeZZqau6%2Bx0WabopxdqLWmecCnm2asopbDqr%2BMrJqorKRiva2tzWarqGWXmsFuvNGenqeZnql8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ojegbenro-olamide-moyosore.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Ojegbenro Olamide Moyosore net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-jay-caufield-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Jay Caufield Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp;
