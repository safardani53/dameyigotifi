<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Artists like <a href=# rel=follow>Dua Lipa</a>, <a href=# rel=follow>Billie Eilish</a>, and Justin Bieber have already started filling up the arenas.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ez-10 class=ez-video-placeholder-marker></span><p>And joining the long list of artists is 2009’s hit boy band, Big Time Rush, formed by Nickelodeon for its TV series of the same name.&nbsp;</p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><p>Out of 1500 teenagers, Kendall Francis Schmidt, James David Maslow, Carlos Roberto Pena Jr., and Logan Phillip Henderson were chosen. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>They had several No.1 hits like ‘Boyfriend’ and ‘Worldwide,’ and their tours would sell out in an instant.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2013, Big Time Rush disbanded, and last year in December 2021, they <a href=# rel=follow>finally reunited</a> for three <a href=# rel="follow noopener">special concerts</a> and released a song entitled ‘Call It Like I See It.’</p><p>But a recent Deuxmoi post suggests that they are not done yet and might go on tour soon. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Big Time Rush and Dixie D’Amelio 2022 Tour</h2><p>On February 17, 2022, Deuxmoi, a pop culture site, shared a tip they received from an anonymous follower.&nbsp;</p><p>The follower claimed that a “reuniting” boy band was going on tour soon, and their opening act would be a TikTok star.</p><p>The artists would be performing everywhere from arenas to stadiums, and in the pseudonym’s section, “dixie chick” was written.&nbsp;

<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Big Time Rush Has Something Coming Up</h2><p>Another thing fans noticed was that Big Time Rush was following&nbsp;D’Amelio on Instagram.&nbsp;</p><p>And the same day Deuxmoi posted the anonymous tip, one of the members, Schmidt, also took to Instagram to make an announcement.</p><p>Schmidt uploaded a photo with the rest of the members and, in the caption, wrote that they were very proud of their upcoming project.&nbsp;</p><p>He added, “Next week is going to be something else,” insinuating that fans would know about in the coming week.&nbsp;</p><p>Fans suspected BTR would be announcing their 2022 tour dates and revealing details of the opening act.&nbsp;</p><p>Most of the reactions in the comments section were positive, with many expressing their excitement at the thought of the boys touring.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“Can’t wait,” a user wrote while another one said, “Drop the tour dates bestie.”</p><p>It looks like the fans are onto something with their theories.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJqZnHq1tcyeZKuto516pbXXopxmnJGisq21zmefraWc</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rolf-harris-documentary-jimmy-savile-girl.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chilling moment Rolf Harris jokes girl is 'safe' with him and Jimmy Savile revealed in ITV doc Hidin</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-andie-mitchell-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Andie Mitchell Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp;
