Mischief Brew was also scheduled to start a European tour at the end of July, though that remains up in the air as well until the band speaks out. For now, their social media accounts remain silent.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Below is a video from Erik’s final performance on July 8, in which he joined the band <strong>Culture Shock</strong> on stage for a song:</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong> has reached out to Mischief Brew for a statement.
