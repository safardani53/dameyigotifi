One of the exciting additions arriving soon on Disney Plus is <a href=#>the Hamilton movie</a>, which is set to drop on July 3.&nbsp;</p><p>This means that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daveed Diggs</a>, and the rest of the cast, is about to get insanely popular all over again.</p><p>Fans are likely looking up all sorts of information about the people behind the Hamilton memorable the character, following the news that they'll be able to stream it this summer.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>As you might already know, Daveed plays Marquis de Lafayette and Thomas Jefferson in the historically-based musical. (The talented actor, rapper, and singer-songwriter won both a Grammy Award and a Tony Award for these roles.)&nbsp;</p><p>Let's take a closer look at Daveed's personal life — specifically, who he is dating.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Daveed Diggs' romantic partner is actress and singer Emmy Raver-Lampman.</h2><p>Currently, Daveed is in a relationship with singer and actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Emmy Raver-Lampman</a>. Daveed and Emmy actually met on the set of Hamilton back in 2015, when she was part of the ensemble cast. However, Daveed was in a relationship at the time.&nbsp;</p><p>Emmy and Daveed have been dating since 2019, and they frequently <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">post about each other on Instagram</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span><p>Daveed with Emmy and 'Hamilton' creator Lin-Manuel Miranda.</p></figure><p>In February 2019, Daveed brought two dates with him to the 2019 Film Independent Spirit Awards in Santa Monica, Calif. — his girlfriend, Emmy, and his Blindspotting love interest, Janina Gavankar.</p><p>(Daveed was nominated for Best Male Lead, but didn't end up winning, FYI.)</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Daveed Diggs has another partner —&nbsp;his BFF Rafael Casal.</h2><p>Not to be confused with his romantic partner, Daveed's business partner is <a href=#>Rafael Casal</a>. The writer, performer, and producer is the co-founder and artistic director of the BARS workshop at The Public Theater in New York.&nbsp;</p><p>Rafael has also collaborated with Daveed on their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">film Blindspotting</a>, as well as an album they created together called Seven Nights in Chicago. The duo is also starring together in Showtime's limited series Good Lord Bird in 2020.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>“As long as I’ve known him, I’ve never had an idea that I didn’t run by him, and that includes character choices in Hamilton,’“ <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daveed said in July 2018</a>. "I don’t have a ton of things that don’t involve him, and even if they don’t in name, realistically they still involve him."</p><p>Rafael feels the same way, adding, “What’s unique about our dynamic is that it’s cross-medium — film, music, theater, television. That’s not even a once-in-a-lifetime thing, because many people go through life and it never happens.”</p><p>So sweet.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What's next for Daveed and Emmy?</h2><p>Post-Hamilton, the love birds have found a lot of success. Daveed has gone on to appear in Blindspotting (like we mentioned above) and has a recurring role on Black-ish. Plus, his new show Snowpiercer —&nbsp;where he plays Andre Layton —&nbsp;is set to premiere in May 2020.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Umbrella Academy fans will also recognize Emmy from the Netflix series, where <a href=#>she plays Allison Hargreeves</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Season 2 of The Umbrella Academy </a>was confirmed shortly after the premiere, and is set to be dropped on the streaming platform soon.</p><p>Luckily, Daveed and Emmy will be able to keep each other grounded.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfma63scSdZJ2hl5zAbrzAq6unnaI%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./even-her-mom-thinks-jessica-simpsons-singing-blows.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Even Her Mom Thinks Jessica Simpson's Singing Blows</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-paul-forman-5-things-to-know-about-the-new-emily-in-paris-hunk-background-past-roles-and-more.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Emily in Paris' Paul Forman? 5 Things to Know</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
