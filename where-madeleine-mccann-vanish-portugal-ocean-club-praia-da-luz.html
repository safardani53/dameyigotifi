href=#>disappeared from her bed</a> in a holiday apartment in Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva, Praia da Luz, a resort in the Algarve region of Portugal.</p><p>The McCanns arrived on Saturday, April 28, 2007, for a&nbsp;seven-night spring break at the&nbsp;two-bedroom, ground-floor apartment.</p><p>It was in the fifth block of a group of apartments known as Waterside Village.</p><p>But on the evening of May 3, she vanished from the apartment where she had been sleeping with her brother and sister.</p><p>Her parents were at a nearby restaurant.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Read More on Madeleine McCann</h2></p><p>That night was due to be the penultimate day of the McCann family holiday.</p><p>The three-year-old's disappearance remains one of the <a href=#>most well-known missing person cases in British history.</a></p><h2>Where is the Ocean Club in&nbsp;Praia da Luz?</h2><p>The apartment is on the edge of travel firm Mark Warner's Ocean Club resort.</p><p>The Ocean Club is&nbsp;one of several tourist sites in the popular holiday town.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Latest on News</h2></p><p>It is located close to the larger town of Lagos, about an hour's drive from Faro airport.</p><p>In February 2017 <a href=#>the apartment was&nbsp;sold to a British gran for £113,000</a> – half the asking price.</p><h2>When did Madeleine McCann disappear?</h2><p>Madeleine vanished on May 3, 2007, when her family, from Leicestershire, were holidaying in the Algarve, Portugal.</p><p>Parents <a href=#>Gerry and Kate</a> left their three children – including toddler twins Sean and Amelie – sleeping in their apartment while they dined at a nearby tapas bar.</p><p>When Kate returned to check on the kids at around 10 pm that evening, she discovered that Maddie was not in her bed.</p><p>In September of that year, Gerry and Kate were named as "arguidos" by Portuguese police.</p><p>While arguido is often translated as "suspect", it actually means a person being questioned under caution.</p><p>The following summer the McCanns were cleared by investigators in Portugal who declared they had exhausted all avenues in the case.</p><p>In 2010, Maddie’s distraught parents met with then-home secretary&nbsp;<a href=#>Theresa May</a> to talk about the hunt for their daughter.</p><p>The following year, Scotland Yard launched its own review, named Operation Grange, into the case at the behest of the future PM.</p><p>Two years later Scotland Yard said it had uncovered new leads while Portuguese police reopened their case.</p><p>In October 2015, Operation Grange was scaled down from 29 detectives to just four.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/nintchdbpict000005343479.jpg><p>In December 2016, the Tory Government injected extra funding into the operation as cops investigated a new theory that Maddie was snatched by a human trafficking ring.</p><p>In October 2017,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;cops said they were now hunting a "person of significance"</a>&nbsp;in a shock new development.</p><p>A source close to Scotland Yard's search Operation Grange said the person is now a "critical line of inquiry" in the £ 13 million search.</p><p>In November 2017 it emerged a new line of enquiry saw cops travel to Bulgaria<a href=#> to try and track down a paedophile's widow.</a></p><p>In March 2018, Scotland Yard won Home Office funding to&nbsp;<a href=#>continue chasing a vital "final line of enquiry"</a>&nbsp;for a further six months.</p><p>Following the conclusion of that six-month period, Scotland Yard made a formal request to the Home Office for a further six months of funding.</p><p>In 2022, Portuguese police formally named convicted rapist&nbsp;<a href=#>Christian Brueckner</a>&nbsp;as the main suspect in Madeleine’s disappearance.</p><p>In May 2023, it was revealed that police <a href=#>launched a major search for McCann's body at a remote reservoir </a>where Christian is said to have visited.</p><p>The area to be searched is the Barragem do Arade reservoir near Silves.</p><h2>How old would Madeleine McCann be now?</h2><p>Maddie turned 20 on May 12, 2023.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Read More in The Sun</h2></p><p>Speaking on her 19th birthday, the <a href=#>McCann's wrote on their website</a>: “Happy birthday Madeleine! We love you and we’re waiting for you. We’re never going to give up.”</p><p>In April 2012, UK cops released a computer-generated image of Maddie showing <a href=#>what she would look like aged nine</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfaIFzhZdrZ2ivmJq%2FpnnMmpuepJWeu6Z5zJyamqaeYsOiusisn2aon6fBtrPApWSom5WWu26vy66ZZqiilraiecOaZKWtqmQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ana-de-la-reguera-s-sexy-images-are-unbearable-is-she-hot-enough.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ana de la Reguera's sexy images are unbearable.
