The shocking release includes 14 new songs, a few of which have fans a bit confused.</p><p>What about "Texts Go Green"? Here’s a breakdown of what the song title and lyrics mean.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is the meaning of "Texts Go Green" by Drake?</h2><p>The lyrics to "Texts Go Green" probably make more sense to iPhone users than to people using androids. When iPhone users are texting each other back-and-forth, their messages pop up in blue-colored bubbles. If you're an iPhone user who's been blocked by another iPhone user, your messages will no longer be blue. They will turn green.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Drake’s lyrics start out, "If I was in your shoes, I would hate myself. Left all this behind to be with someone else."</p><p>In the chorus, he sings, "Texts go green, it hits a little different, don't it? Know you miss the days when I was grippin' on it. Know you're in a house tonight just thinkin' on it. I moved on so long ago."</p><p>In the second verse, he continues, "I'm still tryna make sense of it all. You're still saying things to keep me involved."</p><p>In the third verse, he sings, "Dodging girls on the scene and girls from my dreams. Well, don't wanna make something from nothing, that's where I be. Well, keep getting nothing from something, how's that fair to me?"</p><p>He wraps up the verse with, "It's clear that we all get lonely, then you call me. All I needed from you was to hold me down when things aren't working. For some reason, I believed in you."</p><p>What’s the meaning behind his words?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Things obviously didn’t end well with a woman he was romantically involved with. His lyrics allude to the fact that she seemingly blocked him to move on to a relationship with someone else. He describes the fact that he rejected other women while he focused on this one particular person.</p><p>However, now this woman has come back around and it's seemingly too little too late. He doesn't want to be strung along anymore and now he's the one rejecting her. He says he would hate himself if he was in her shoes — feeling regretful about risking their relationship for another man.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Here’s how fans are reacting to Drake's album "Honestly, Nevermind."</h2><p>There are mixed reviews from hip hop fans in regards to Drake‘s new album, "Honestly, Nevermind." <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">One person tweeted</a>, “I don't care what anyone says, Drake’s new album must be one of the worst albums he has ever made. Drake is a great artist but this is a no. I'm so disappointed.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Another person tweeted</a>, “One word for the new Drake album: mid.”</p><p>However, other fans seem to be impressed and defended Drake's album. One <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>, “Y’all say Drake’s album [is] a** but [he’s going to] have these clubs and festivals jumping. This n**** knew who his target audience is and if you don’t like it, it’s clearly not made for you.”</p><p>“Texts Go Green" is obviously only one major song to listen to from the new album. We also recommend checking out “Currents,” “Sticky,” and “Jimmy Cooks.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbK5wNJmnqhll6eyprqMnamao5ViuqatzaKloA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-maggie-lindemann-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Maggie Lindemann Dating Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sherri-coale.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sherri Coale</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
