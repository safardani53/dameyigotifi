The fourth season will include the franchise’s first same-sex relationship: <strong>Stephanie </strong>and <strong>Erika</strong>. In addition, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Darcey Silva</strong></a> is back for season 4. This will be her fourth round on the show. Meet all the season 4 couples below.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>While the premiere of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>90 Day Fiance</a>: Before the 90 Days&nbsp;is a little bit down the road, there is a brand-new mini-series that’s right around the corner. 90 Day Fiance: Just Landed is available on TLC GO now and will premiere Dec. 23 on TLC. The new series will follow three couples right before the foreign-born partner arrives into the US and immediately after touchdown, documenting their first 24-hours together. The couples featured include: <strong>Ray</strong>, 31 (Salinas, Calif.) & <strong>Angelique</strong>, 31 (Philippines); <strong>Cole</strong>, 28 (Green Bay, Wis.) & <strong>Maria</strong>, 24 (Colombia); and <strong>Kendahl</strong>, 30 (Boca Raton, Fla.) and<strong> Hedi</strong>, 25 (Tunisia).</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><strong>Stephanie, 29 (Yonkers, NY) & Erika, 24 (Australia)</strong><br>As a social media influencer, Stephanie is used to receiving messages from her followers. She never expected, however, that one of her fans would become her next love interest. For the last three months, she’s been in an online relationship with Erika, a spunky Australian photographer, but has been keeping Erika and her own sexual orientation a secret from her family. Stephanie is unsure how to break the news to her parents that she will be traveling to Australia to meet a woman she loves. To further complicate the situation, she has a rare bone marrow disorder that requires clearance from her doctors to travel, as well as several medications to keep her stable. Stephanie is risking her health to meet the woman of her dreams, but is Erika only in love with her online persona or with the real Stephanie?</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>Ed, 54 (San Diego, Calif.) & Rosemarie, 23 (Philippines)</strong><br>Despite being under five feet tall, Ed is best known as “Big Ed” for his larger than life personality. After living the single life for 28 years, Big Ed met the love of his life, Rosemarie, through social media. Now, he’s ready to take the leap and meet her for the first time in the Philippines, bringing along his hopes for a second chance at love as well as an engagement ring. But the challenges that come with a 31-year age gap, the disapproval of his only daughter and unanswered questions about Rosemarie’s past threaten to cut Big Ed’s fairytale romance short.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>Geoffrey, 41 (Knoxville, Tenn.) & Varya, 30 (Russia)</strong><br>The last few years have been rough for Geoffrey. Shortly after his second marriage ended in divorce, he suffered the tragic loss of his son. But life started to look up when he met Varya on an international dating site. Despite their cultural differences, they quickly bonded over their shared love of adventure. Now, Geoffrey has a trip to Russia on the horizon and is considering proposing to Varya, but he must first prove to her family and friends that he’s the right man for her.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>Avery, 32 (Seattle, Wash.) & Ash, 38 (Australia)</strong><br>When Avery and Ash connected on Instagram nine months ago, the single mother of two was immediately smitten. Their physical attraction turned into a soulful connection, and now Avery is headed to Australia to meet Ash in person. But Ash’s profession as a relationship coach paired with Avery’s distrust of the amount of time he spends talking with single women have already led to multiple break-ups. Will Avery meet a man that can provide the stability she craves for her and her kids, or will Ash be another failed relationship?</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>Lisa, 52 (York, Pa.) & Usman “SojaBoy,” 30 (Nigeria)</strong><br>When Lisa found Usman’s profile on social media, she had no idea that he is a famous entertainer and musician in Nigeria, better known by his stage name, “SojaBoy.” Lisa was immediately attracted to this younger man, but past relationships have left her with many trust issues, causing her to lash out at Usman’s fans and threaten them to stay away from her man. Despite her jealousy, Usman proposed, and Lisa is heading to Nigeria to marry a man she’s never met before. During this fateful trip, Lisa will need to win over Usman’s disapproving mother and friends or risk losing him forever.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>David, 60 (Las Vegas, Nev.) & Lana, 27 (Ukraine)</strong><br>David, a cat-loving computer programmer, swore off American women forever after a series of failed relationships. Having always been attracted to Slavic beauties, he tried his luck on a Ukrainian dating website and fell in love with Lana. Now, after seven years of speaking online, he is taking his fourth trip to Ukraine to meet her. He’s tried three times before, but each trip ended in Lana ghosting him. David has already spent roughly $100,000 on the relationship and hopes this journey will finally lead to them meeting in person and getting engaged. If Lana doesn’t show up again, however, David is adamant this will be the last straw in their complicated relationship, and he will never spend a dollar on her again.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10><strong>Darcey, 45 (Middletown, Conn.) and Tom, 39 (United Kingdom)</strong><br>The self-professed lover of love, Darcey is back and continuing to test the waters with her British “James Bond,” Tom. Last season on Before the 90 Days, she traveled to the U.K. to meet him in person for the first time after speaking online for four years. They hit it off, but the trip was not without its problems. Now, viewers will continue to follow the pair as they try to resolve their differences and find out if being together forever is in their future</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH5ze5BxZnJoXZmuunnFopinm5Vir6ayzqucZqyYmnp6fIydmLKrXaiyor%2FOp2RtZZOkwrG4xKxm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./christina-applegate-1st-public-outing-since-ms-diagnosis.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Christina Applegate, 1st Public Outing Since MS Diagnosis</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./austin-meadows.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Austin Meadows</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
