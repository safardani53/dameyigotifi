And, yeah, he found someone else on his boats, and I didn’t know for a couple of months.”</p><p>Checketts has not commented on the split or on the infidelity accusations at this time, but fans saw him trying to keep in contact with his ex during season 6 of the Bravo show.</p><p>White also admitted that she was “not in a place to look for romance,” <a href=#>even though <strong>David Pascoe</strong> showed interest in her during their time on the Lady Michelle.</a></p><p>“I think I even told David [about the split, explaining] that everything with Tom and I was falling apart right before we filmed this season,” she told Us in July. “I was a mess coming into it and I was just like, ‘You know, I don’t really want to even see men right now.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>At the time, White shared that <a href=#>she wasn’t ruling out boatmances in general because of the industry</a> that she is in.</p><p>“The people you work around are the ones you build these close relationships with. And for us, these may be the only people we meet for months at a time,” she explained. “So, you naturally develop feelings toward people.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabnZykxG6wxJyiZqWVmcBuucCloJplo5qyrrXNoKOyZZSWwaq6xmaYp2WVo7SqusSeqWaeoqS6bsDHnmSsoJ%2BsfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gwendlyn-brown-my-brother-paedon-is-a-big-ol-racist.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bisexuality is Real!
