In the 2011 NFL Draft, Newton was picked first overall by the Carolina Panthers.</span></p><p>Cam appeared in 11 seasons, exclusively with the Carolina Panthers of the National Football League (NFL).</p><p>Also known as “<strong>Super</strong> <strong>Cam</strong>,” he leads NFL in quarterback rushing touchdowns and is second in quarterback rushing yards.</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In 2010, he received the Heisman Trophy at Auburn. He is the master of the NFL at 67 in quarterback rushing touchdowns.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Surprisingly, Newton won the NFL Offensive, Rookie of the Year for&nbsp;4,000 yards in his first season. However, Cam was the first rookie quarterback to pass.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/cam.png><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Newton led the Panthers to three divisional championships and four playoff appearances between 2013 and 2017.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Cam is the second and first African-American quarterback to earn the NFL MVP.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Newton struggled with injuries after his MVP Campaign as the Panthers reached the playoffs just once in their next four seasons.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He was released after missing the bulk of the 2019 season due to surgery.</span></p><p>He signed one year deal with the New England Patriots in 2020, which includes an average salary of <strong>$1.05</strong> <strong>million,</strong> with the possible upgrade of $7.05 million from incentives and time bonuses.</p><p><span>Newton signed a one-year contract with the Carolina Panthers in 2021 for <strong>$10 million</strong>. He is the leading NFL quarterback.</span></p><p>As per recent sources, he receives an average salary of <strong>$22.2 million.</strong></p><h2>Cam Newton | Cheating Scandal</h2><p>It was scandalous news when it was revealed that Cam had a child with another woman while in a relationship with Kia Proctor.</p><p>While appearing on ‘The Pivot,’ he talked about his embarrassing cheating scandal and shared why he did not want to hide his son Caesar Lorenzo Newton.</p><p>“I was on temptation island. A football player, young, ‘no’ is not even in my vocabulary,”</p><p>&nbsp;The first overall pick in the 2011 NFL Draft and 2015 NFL MVP said.</p><p>“I just found myself in this downward spiral. Did she deserve better? I would humbly say, yes, she did…I was falling deeper into my selfishness and realizing I gotta be better.”</p><p>He welcomed his son with model <strong>LA Reina Shaw</strong> in 2020.</p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Kia Proctor | Net Worth And Salary</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>No one cared much about Kia Proctor’s net worth before breaking it up with her boyfriend, Cam Newton, because she was presumably well cared for with the <strong>$75 million</strong> from the NFA player.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Nevertheless, after a messy breakup and all the altercations over the custody of children take a toll on their lives, people become more curious before the fame about the elegant model’s life and how she won her cash.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>As stated before, she draws in her bucks through enormous endorsements.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Kia was keenly involved in dancing throughout her early Career.
