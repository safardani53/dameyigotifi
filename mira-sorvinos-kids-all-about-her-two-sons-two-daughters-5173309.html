Some of her most famous work includes starring in Romy and Michele’s High School Reunion&nbsp;alongside&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lisa Kudrow</strong></a>,&nbsp;Mighty Aphrodite, The Replacement Killers, and others. Not only is the 56-year-old a starlet herself, but her late father,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Paul Sorvino</strong></a>, was also a famous actor. The&nbsp;Goodfellas&nbsp;star <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>died in 2022</a> at the age of 83.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Most recently, Mira made headlines once more after she began competing on the 32nd season of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Dancing with the Stars</a>&nbsp;in 2023. She’s partnered up with Gleb Savchenko, and they’ve made it to the fifth week of the competition. For Most Memorable Year Night, Mira has chosen the year 2004, a moment in her life that changed everything. During the October 24 episode, Mira will be dancing alongside her daughter, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Mattea Backus</strong></a>. Scroll down to learn more about all of her kids.</p><h2>Mattea Backus</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>The blonde beauty and her husband, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Christopher Backus</strong></a> welcomed their first child in 2004. Mattea was born on November 3, 2004, notably the same year that her parents tied the knot. At the time, Mira was 37 years old, while her hubby was 23 years old. The now 18-year-old is currently a college student at Tufts University.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Mattea will make a special appearance during the October 24 episode of DWTS. She’ll dance a contemporary routine with her mom and Gleb. “I am so excited because, this week, I get to live out another dream which is to dance with my daughter,” Mira told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ET</a> ahead of the episode. “Gleb choreographed this incredible dance to ‘Time After Time’ about the love between parents and a daughter and, you know, her going away and coming back but love always returns and we always end up together in the end. And it’s really beautiful.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Mattea is already a dancer. She gushed in a video posted on the Dancing with the Stars Instagram Story that dancing with her mom in the ballroom is going to be the “most incredible memory.”</p><h2>Johnny Christopher King Backus</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>Nearly two years after Mattea’s birth, Mira and Christopher welcomed their first son, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Johnny Christopher King Backus</strong></a>. The now 17-year-old was born on May 29, 2006, and grew up to be close to his older sister. In fact, Mattea wished her brother a happy birthday via Instagram on May 29, 2019. She honored him by sharing a series of <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>throwback photos</a> of them during their childhood. “Happy birthday to my partner in crime love you,” she captioned the sweet post.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Johnny most recently announced his commitment to attend the University of Michigan. “Extremely grateful and excited to announce my commitment to play division 1 baseball at the University of Michigan. Thank you to God, my family, friends, and all the coaches who helped me along the way,” he captioned his September 2023 <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>post</a>.</p><h2><strong>Holden </strong>Backus</h2><p id=content-paragraph-15>Later, Mira and her spouse welcomed <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>another son</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Holden Backus</strong></a>, on June 22, 2009. The 14-year-old was born just three years after his older brother and nearly five years after Mattea. Most recently, Mira took to Instagram in August 2023 to share a series of <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>family photos</a> with her loved ones at <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Disneyland</a>. “Great as always @disneyland day!! Already missing you @matteaabackus,” the proud momma captioned the post. In the snapshots, Holden rocked a New York Times t-shirt while Mattea opted for overalls. Mira looked chic in a pink Disneyland t-shirt alongside Christopher, who also rocked a Mickey Mouse shirt.</p><h2><strong>Lucia </strong>Backus</h2><p id=content-paragraph-18>The couple’s youngest daughter, <strong>Lucia Backus</strong>, completed their adorable family when she was born on May 3, 2012. The now 11-year-old is Mira’s second daughter and is notably eight years younger than Mattea. Both of her daughters joined their mom at the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>SAG-AFTRA strike</a> in July 2023. “With my girls and my delightful @jeffsastrof on the @sagaftra @wgawest picket line. You can’t see it here but there were so many of our union brothers and sisters out there, fighting joyfully for what is reasonable, fair and decent,” Mira captioned the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photos</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8yiqZplo6S%2Ft7XNqKpmo5mZwG6ty6VkmpqfqsFutMSrZK2vn2LAsLrSZquwp12Zrrazx62cq6tdan54f5JpcGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./artem-chigvintsev.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Artem Chigvintsev Celebrity Profile Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-bobcat-goldthwait-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Bobcat Goldthwait Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
