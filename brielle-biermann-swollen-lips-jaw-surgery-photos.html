Not only is the surgery itself a daunting process but the aftermath was just as challenging for Brielle. She posted a pic of her flipping off the camera as her lips as well as the rest of the bottom of her face was as swollen as can be. “Never forget when I looked like this,” she wrote along with the pic on her Instagram Story. “2 days after double jaw surgery.” Take a look at the drastic swelling for yourself <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>here.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Brielle-Biermann-lip-surgery-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-2><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Brielle</a> even clarified that her lips weren’t extra big because of her lip injections because she had to have them removed ahead of the surgery. “let it be known I had no lip injections at this time,” she wrote along with another picture of her face swollen and jaw wired shut. “I had to dissolve it allllll before surgery which was a b**ch.” She also vented that because she had her jaw wired, she had to be on an all-liquid diet which caused her to lose 15 pounds and she was “not happy.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>She shared that she had the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>surgery</a> in August 2021. At that time, she posted some other pictures of her rough recovery from the surgery and shared why she had the surgery in the first place. “sooooo… i had double jaw surgery on august 23 to correct my tmj & 9 mm overjet overbite. this was NOT for aesthetics but for quality of life,” she explained.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“I sucked my thumb til i was 9 ishhh which made the roof of my mouth suuuuuper narrow and my excessive overbite cause my teeth to have no contact whatsoever,” she continued. She explained that she struggled eating everyday food like pizza because of her overbite and also revealed it caused her to have a bit of a lisp.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Brielle</a> also admitted that she was really nervous going into the surgery.“I was so scared,” she continued. “I was completely dreading this surgery fearing the worst of the worst but thankfully with my positive mindset, strong family & friends support system … I got thru the first two weeks, which are supposed to be the hardest, easy breezy!” While she seems to be admitting the recovery wasn’t so easy breezy now, it seems she still got through it and can put all of it behind her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e5BrZpuqmZq5rbGMm6Ceqp2Wu6950rCmpaSVo3qttc%2BsZKOZp2LAtr7GnqmyZaCdvLW70mg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./john-ford-musician.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | John Ford (musician) net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./artem-chigvintsev.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Artem Chigvintsev Celebrity Profile Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
