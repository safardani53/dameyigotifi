They are always in need of competitors to help make for <a href=#>compelling TV</a>, and it really isn't all that hard to get folks jazzed on camera when there's so much at stake.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p><a href=#>Press Your Luck</a> is no exception, and the revived game show hosted by <a href=#>Elizabeth Banks</a> has a fairly easy-to-follow process for game show enthusiasts who want to try and get on the show to follow.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Here's how to get on 'Press Your Luck.'</h2><p>The easiest way to get on Press Your Luck would probably be to know someone in production and hit them up for a favor, but if you don't happen to have anyone who fits that bill in your Rolodex, then all you need to do is follow the instructions on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">show's official casting web page here</a>. And yes, that is the official site for applications. I know.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>There do seem to be a few stipulations for whom producers will select for the show, however. It looks like they're only looking for Southern California residents, which would make sense because the program is filmed in Hollywood. Schedules are always shifting, and showrunners probably don't want to have to deal with the headache of rescheduling a bunch of out-of-towners on the program.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What are the requirements for appearing on 'Press Your Luck'?</h2><p>First off, you've got to be at least 21 years of age or older and you have to be a resident of the United States. You also can't be related to anyone who's worked on the show or for ABC within 12 months of your application date, nor can you be affiliated with any of the sponsors or companies who are providing prizes to the series.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While all of that seems like run-of-the-mill production stuff, some strange stipulations may give folks pause upon seeing them. According to the casting requirements, "You may not be a candidate for public office nor become a candidate for public office until at least one year following the initial broadcast of the last episode of the series in which you appear."</p><p>Other restrictions seem to make sense, like the fact that you can't be convicted of a felony or have had a restraining order placed against you. Probably don't want to be giving away a brand new washing machine to a legit stalker who steals their ex's car just so they can remember what the smell is like.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Then there are a bunch of fairly straightforward information blocks the show's team presents on its casting page: your first and last name, your hometown, if you've spoken already to someone at the Press Your Luck team, your relationship status, preferred pronoun, your occupation, a few zany facts about yourself, and what you would do if you happened to win a ton of money and what you'd want to buy for your loved ones if you got that money.</p><p>In total, there are about 36 fields you'll need to fill out to submit your completed application to the show in order to be considered for an appearance, including a headshot or recent photo.</p><p>So are you going to apply for a chance to get on Press Your Luck? Or are you more of a <a href=#>Price Is Right</a> kinda person?</p><p>Catch new eps of Press Your Luck Thursdays at 8 p.m. EST on ABC. You can also stream the show on Hulu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4edOoZKCdpGK8r3nPq5ysq12uvLa%2BjKWsnKM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jennifer-batten-19571129-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jennifer Batten (Guitarist) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./orange-is-the-new-black-daya-bennett-dascha-polanco-interview-oitnb.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Daya &amp;amp; Bennetts Romance Dascha Polanco Interview Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
