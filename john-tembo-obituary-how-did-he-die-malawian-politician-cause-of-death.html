Malawi has suffered a significant loss as a result of John Tembo’s death.</p><h2>John Tembo’s Early Life And Career</h2><p>Tembo was born on September 14, 1932, in the Dedza District of the Central Region. His father, Zenus Ungapake Tembo, was a minister for the Church of Central African Presbyterians (CCAP).&nbsp;He attended many elementary schools before enrolling at Blantyre Secondary School. Later, he traveled to Lesotho to study political philosophy at the University of Roma, where he graduated with honors in 1958.</p><p>After a short spell at Dedza Secondary School, he began teaching for two years at Robert Blake Secondary School in Dowa’s central district in 1958.&nbsp;Tembo was encouraged to compete for a parliamentary seat in the Dedza South district in 1960, two years after Dr. Banda arrived in the country from Ghana to head the anti-British colonial movement.&nbsp;Tembo was elected to the country’s legislative assembly in 1961, three years before Nyasaland became independent and became the Republic of Malawi.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/John-Tembo-5.jpg alt="John Tembo" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>After Malawi’s independence, he succeeded Henry Phillips (later Sir Henry Phillips) as its second finance minister.
