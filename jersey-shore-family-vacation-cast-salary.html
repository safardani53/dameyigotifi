Starting out as a group of strangers who agreed to spend the summer with each other, Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi, Jenni "JWoww" Farley, Sammi "Sweetheart" Giancola, Angelina Pivarnick, Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino, Vinny Guadagnino, Pauly Delvecchio, and Ronnie Ortiz-Magro are now all grown up and friends for life.&nbsp;</p><p>This means that they’re reuniting for another season of&nbsp;<a href=#>Jersey Shore: Family Vacation</a> (<a href=#>mostly</a>).</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Over&nbsp;Jersey Shore's six-season run, the roommates were paid well, as evidenced by the luxurious lifestyle each of them lives today. But while they were all compensated for their appearances on the show, each cast member commanded a different salary depending on how popular they were with the fans. With the fourth season of Jersey Shore: Family Vacation, viewers want to know what kind of <a href=#>salary each cast member makes</a> today, especially now that they’re all well-established celebrities.&nbsp;</p><h2>What is the salary and current net worth of each roommate on Jersey Shore: Family Vacation?</h2><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>As everyone’s favorite meatball, Snooki was probably the reason you got hooked on to Jersey Shore in the first place. Snooki quickly established herself as a fan-favorite with catchphrases like “WAH” and her fondness for doing backflips in the middle of the club. Nicole was such a hit on the show that she went from making $2,200 per episode in the first season to an impressive $150,000 an episode in the final two seasons.</p><p>Today, she has an estimated net worth of about $4 million.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jenni “JWoww” Farley</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Snooki’s partner-in-crime, JWoww, was responsible for some of the most epic drunken fights during the early seasons of the show. Who can forget the fight with Sammi when JWoww lost all of her fake lashes and nails, or the time she punched Mike “The Situation” in the face, or the time she cheated on her then-boyfriend with Pauly D (and subsequently revealed to everyone that he had a penis piercing)?&nbsp;</p><p>Her crazy antics earned JWoww $100,000 per episode and after Jersey Shore wrapped up, she appeared on Snooki & JWoww. Her estimated net worth is around $4 million.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Mike “The Situation” Sorrentino</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Known for his rock-hard abs and diabolical mind, Mike “The Situation” is one of the Jersey Shore cast’s top earners. “The Situation” commands $150,000 per episode, which amounts to around $2 million to appear in a single season.&nbsp;</p><p>But despite all his hard-earned cash, why does Mike have a relatively lower net worth of $300,000? Mike had an <a href=#>unfortunate run-in with the IRS</a>, and in 2017 it was revealed that he was being charged with tax evasion and filing a false tax return for his clothing business, Situation Nation.&nbsp;</p><p>Hopefully appearing on Jersey Shore: Family Vacation will help him bring that number up again.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Deena Cortese</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>When Angelina made her second and final exit from the series during Season 3, Deena stepped in and steadily made her way into fans’ hearts. The self-named “Blast in a Glass” managed to get herself arrested, hooked up with men and women, and gave audiences some full-frontal nudity, cementing herself as an indispensable cast member.&nbsp;</p><p>In the past, Deena was making a shockingly low salary compared to the other roommates at $40,000 per episode. However, since appearing on a couple of seasons of Jersey Shore as well as Couples Therapy, Deena now commands $100,000 per episode for Jersey Shore: Family Vacation.&nbsp;</p><p>She’s estimated to have a solid $1 million net worth.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Angelina Pivarnick</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Angelina only appeared on Jersey Shore for two seasons, but both times, she left the house early to go home. Angelina reportedly was making $3,000 per episode for Season 1 and was bumped up to $15,000 for Season 2. By the third season, Angelina had left the show for good.&nbsp;</p><p>That is, until her return on Jersey Shore: Family Vacation. Although she had a short stint on the show, Angelina managed to rack up an impressive $2 million from her time on Jersey Shore, and it’s assumed that she’s making much more than $15,000 per episode for Jersey Shore: Family Vacation, since she seems to be doing all the heavy lifting in terms of bringing the drama.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Vinny Guadagnino</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Viewers quickly fell in love with Vinny’s classic Italian charm and undying love for his mother, and soon he was earning $90,000 per episode on the original Jersey Shore, an amount he still commands for Jersey Shore: Family Vacation.&nbsp;</p><p>Since his rise to reality stardom, Vinny’s also appeared on two seasons of A Double Shot at Love, and hosted a talk show called The Show With Vinny.&nbsp;</p><p>Vinny now has an estimated net worth of $3 million.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ronnie Ortiz-Magro</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>For his messiness, infidelities, and constant gaslighting of Sammi, Ronnie earned an impressive $80,000 per episode. This was later bumped up to $150,000 per episode, given his penchant for starting fights and always instigating or being in the center of drama.&nbsp;</p><p>Ronnie still makes $150,000 per episode and has a net worth of around $3 million.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Paul “DJ Pauly D” Delvecchio</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>No one has contributed more catchphrases to Jersey Shore than Pauly D. From “It’s T-Shirt Time” to “Cabs Are Here,” Pauly D&nbsp;gained a passionate fan base and earned $150,000 per episode while on Jersey Shore, which is also the salary he makes for his appearances on Jersey Shore: Family Vacation.&nbsp;</p><p>Pauly’s also been on two seasons of A Double Shot at Love with Vinny, and in addition to his reality show work, Pauly also makes money from DJing all over the world.&nbsp;</p><p>His current net worth is an extremely impressive $20 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7Kzv8SyZKygn6eybrLApqClsV2rrqSt06Kmp2WTlsC1edKao5qqqQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lizzo-responds-to-backlash-for-doing-a-10-day-juice-cleanse.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lizzo Responds to Backlash for Doing a 10-Day Juice Cleanse</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./charisse-mills.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Charisse Mills</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
