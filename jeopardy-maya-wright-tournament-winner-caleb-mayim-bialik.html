Wow," one Twitter user wrote.</p><p>"Yesss love when the girlies win" wrote another.</p><p>"YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAY~~ beat those guys!" posted a third as a fourth wrote: "fire clutch performance. Love to see it. S/O to her for not giving up."</p><p>"Why am I crying at the #Jeopardy high school reunion rn???" wrote a fifth.</p><p>Over on Reddit in a game thread a user gushed: "Yaaaaaaas Maya! Slow and steady wins the race."</p><p>Another wrote: "So Maya is the only previous finalist to make it back to the finals. Love this for her."</p><p>"These reunion games have been so close and unpredictable. Love it!" applauded a third.</p><p>"I wanted to see a Maya & Claire [Sattler] rematch in the finals but still looking forward to the finals looks to be a fun 2 day event," wrote one more.</p><h2>'THE LOSS WAS BITTER'</h2><p>Caleb then chimed into the thread: "Hi guys! Popping in once again to say there’s no better person to lose to twice than Maya!</p><p>I’ve never felt more adrenaline than I did during that Double Jeopardy round, and the loss was especially bitter because Roget was my blind guess after hearing the <a href=#>category</a> but I second-guessed myself and panicked because of nerves.</p><p>But as I said, Maya is a fantastic person to lose to, and it’s very funny to say I have lost twice to someone 16 inches shorter than me."</p><h2>'WE BECAME BEST FRIENDS'</h2><p>Maya, a human health and Spanish double-major and president of the Emory Quiz Bowl team, told <a aria-label="Emory.edu (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Emory.edu </a>about how she was feeling after filming the special.</p><p>Maya, <a href=#>Claire Sattler,</a> and <a href=#>fan-favorite Emma Arnold</a> (sadly absent from this special as she is at Cambridge) faced off in the finals in the 2018 Teen Tournament.</p><p>Claire, who won in 2018,<a href=#> lost last night </a>so seeing Maya advance from the ever-enjoyable girls' club of that event probably meant even more.</p><p>Maya told the outlet of her 2018 tournament pals: "We have a group chat, and if any of us travel through a city where we know the other ones live, we’ll meet up and go to lunch. We knew each other for less than a week and we became best friends."</p><p>She also said on being back five years later: "It was surreal. All of us were staying in the same hotel, and the night before we started filming, we ate dinner.</p><p>It wasn’t real to us even though we had all flown to LA. It didn’t hit me until we had to practice with the buzzers, and they played the intro music. When I was standing on the stage, that’s when it hit me."</p><p>Maya and her other finalists will duke it out in two-night finals and if she wins, she'd be a welcome addition to the <a href=#>2023 Tournament of Champions which - in contrast- is currently only men.</a></p><p><a href=#>Regular episodes</a> and <a href=#>Ken Jennings</a>, 48, are <a href=#>returning on Friday</a>, March 10 when it concludes.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Ken will host until April 28 at which point Mayim will finish out the season which ends this summer.</p><p>The co-hosts began filling in for the <a href=#>late, great Alex Trebek</a> in 2021 and so far fans and contestants have made it no secret they <a href=#>prefer the 74-time champ's hosting style to the actress' lack of flow.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/epic-disc-jeopardy-fans-die-799552172-8.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/player-maya-wright-holds-back-801205710-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvZWyAdoKSaKGep6CWv6XFjKaYspldrL%2Bqs8etZK2npae7ornEp6tmr5mju6a%2BjJyYpZ2SYrqixcimZJuhkaG2rHs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kenneth-tobey.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kenneth Tobey</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./new-york-islanders.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | New York Islanders net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
