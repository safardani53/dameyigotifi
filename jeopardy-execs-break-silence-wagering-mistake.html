You bet nothing. Interesting.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>After Kendra’s answer was revealed to be wrong, her bet of $5,201 left her with $17,999 - enough to win despite being incorrect.</p><h2>'ERROR ON JOHN'S PART...'</h2><p>On Monday, <a href=#>Producer Sarah Foss</a> and <a href=#>former champion Buzzy Cohen</a> denounced the decision as a flat-out mistake and explained why it didn't add up.</p><p>Kendra, in first place, had more than 2/3 of John's score going in, and she missed it with a standard cover bet, but he still didn't win - so betting $0 had no strategic benefit.</p><p>Foss said on the <a href=#>official podcast Inside Jeopardy!</a> while recapping last week's games: "John was the only one who was correct in Final but unfortunately&nbsp;mis-wagered from second place."</p><p>Buzzy replied: “I'm not totally sure what John was up to there.</p><p>"Because imagine a world where Kendra [in first place] was betting to cover, which she did and it goes wrong, he still doesn't have enough [earnings to win].”</p><p>“So I think that may have just been a tactical error on John’s part.</p><p>"I'm not sure where that $0 wager came from.</p><p>"Maybe he’s imagining Kendra overplaying her hand or something?”</p><p>Foss responded: “I think in that moment, there's so much going on on that stage in that time.</p><p>"With all these contestants know, they often say the math what they come to dread the most.</p><p>"It's not a category they may not know, it's having to do math in Final.</p><p>"John is a victim to exactly all the fears happening," she somberly noted.</p><p>"Has to feel great about a great game, but certainly, he will be thinking about that wager for many years.”</p><h2>FANS LOSE THEIR MINDS OVER $0 WAGER</h2><p>While Ken and, now, the insiders, have expressed surprise at John’s choice, fans were downright flabbergasted when it aired.</p><p>“A bonehead wager by John!” one person wrote on the Jeopardy! <a href=#>YouTube</a> page.</p><p>Another posted, “It must hurt to lose, but it must really hurt to lose because you were timid.”</p><p>“John’s about to get lit up for making such a poor wager,” a third fan wrote, and another person joked, “I’ll start.”</p><p>A fourth fan wrote on&nbsp;<a href=#>X</a>: "The zero wager made zero sense."</p><p>Another wrote: "Goodness gracious! Another MAJOR boo-boo by this #Jeopardy contestant. Can't he count?"</p><p>A sixth wrote: "Geez, what was up with that Final #Jeopardy wager?"</p><p>A seventh wrote: "Terrible wager by No. 2 contestant!" and an eigth: "John...come on man."</p><p>Since the <a href=#>Season 40</a> premiere last month, Jeopardy! has been pulling contestants from past seasons and using old clues and clues that were previously written but never aired.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>This was a way around the writer's strike, which concluded two weeks ago.</p><p>The <a href=#>game show</a> is now airing a <a href=#>Champions Wildcard</a> tournament for brief Season 37 and Season 38 winners, hosted by Ken until December 18.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/fans-speechless-player-john-bussard-850090809-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/fans-speechless-player-john-bussard-850090804-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/announced-full-schedule-lineup-brand-848060913-4.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxYm2Ed32UaKGep6CWv6XFjJ6vnpujYq%2BzscCkZKyhnJq7pLGMsJignaKeu6h5zKKqrZmbmnw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./shows.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>List of TV Shows starting with the Letter F Us Weekly</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jeah-ryan-lochte-to-trademark-catchphrase.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>JEAH!!
