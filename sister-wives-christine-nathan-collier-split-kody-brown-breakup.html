After a three-year battle in the US District Court, fighting for the&nbsp;right to legally marry second wife Christine, Nathan is now still married to Victoria "Vicki" Collier.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/christine-collier-nathan-collier-victoria-784164479.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/nathan-christine-victoria-collier-kody-784166926.jpg><p>"I can confirm that yes we have split at the end of July of&nbsp;this year," Christine, 46, told The U.S. Sun exclusively.</p><p>This came after <a href=#>Kody</a> confirmed his splits from <a href=#>Janelle</a> and his third wife <a href=#>Christine</a>&nbsp;during the <a href=#>Sister Wives</a> One on One: Part 1 special.&nbsp;</p><p>Christine, citing "irreconcilable&nbsp;differences" as the grounds for the split,&nbsp;added: "It's personal. I'd rather not air that information (why they split)."</p><h2><strong>THREE-YEAR COURT BATTLE</strong></h2><p>Nathan, 53, and Vicki, 49, were legally married in Dillon, <a href=#>South Carolina</a>, on April 26, 2000. In 2007, he tied&nbsp;the knot to Christine in a religious ceremony, without signing a marriage license.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More Sister Wives">Read More Sister Wives</h2><p>On June 30, 2015, Nathan attempted to apply for a marriage license to his second wife at the Yellowstone County Clerk of District Court in Montana, but his application was denied.</p><p>His court filing to amend the state's anti-polygamy laws made national news at the time following their appearance on Sister Wives where they opened up about their polygamous lifestyle.&nbsp;</p><p>Nathan, who's still based in Billings, <a href=#>Montana</a>, was hoping to make a change after the Supreme Court's ruling on same-sex marriage that took place that same month.&nbsp;</p><p>In March 2018, after three years of arguing in court, the judge rejected Nathan and his wives' case to overturn the state's anti-polygamy laws.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>In the court document obtained by The U.S. Sun, United States Magistrate Judge Timothy J. Cavan concluded: "Even after giving the Colliers the benefit of the substantial doubt that they have formulated a concrete plan to violate Mont. Code Ann. §§ 45-5-611 or 612, the Court finds that the Colliers have failed to demonstrate injury in fact because they have not shown a threat of prosecution or a history of enforcement, and therefore they do not have standing to challenge those criminal statutes."</p><p>The Colliers had 14 days to file written objections of the judge's findings and recommendations, but never went through with it.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>'UNEXPECTED BREAKUP'</strong></h2><p>Christine, who helped parent eight children jointly with the Colliers,&nbsp;said that she's now in a "new relationship," but did not want to disclose more information on her life today or share more about her former spiritual marriage.</p><p>She said that she had learned about the Sister Wives' split through a friend, and told The U.S. Sun: "I was not friends with them, nor did we keep close afterward [the show].</p><p>"Whatever is going on in their family ... it's their business. I try to stay out of other people's business."&nbsp;</p><p>In the Sister Wives' 2015 episode that featured the Colliers, the Montana-based family hosted the Browns at their home where they discussed their polygamist lifestyles and had fun on the property riding ATVs with their kids.&nbsp;</p><p>The Colliers talked about their plans to build a duplex, having separate kitchens but a shared basement as a common living room for the family.</p><p>Vicki said in the episode: "We want an even balance. We would like a little more space, autonomy, but at the same time, will not compromise our unity."</p><p>Christine added: "Our children thrive on that unity. They need that unity. We are one unit. Even though we are two different marriages and two separate marriages, we're one unit."</p><p>A source told The U.S. Sun: "Everyone was pining for Nathan to have a [TV] series because he had such a great family. His family's breakup is completely unexpected."</p><h2><strong>FUTURE OF POLYGAMY</strong></h2><p>Kody, 53, recently <a href=#>shared insight</a> on his past marriages to <a href=#>Meri</a>, Christine and Janelle.</p><p>For one, Kody - whose fourth wife is <a href=#>Robyn</a>- claimed that Christine said that she was in a "loveless marriage" and called her a "manipulator" in the <a href=#>first episode of the tell-all</a> that aired on Sunday, December 18.</p><p>"All these polygamous families are <a href=#>falling apart</a>, and the men are starting to see a pattern," an insider shared.</p><p>"To have these women mock and do what they did publicly to Kody, gave these other women the power and the courage to walk away as well.&nbsp;It's a big deal in the polygamy world right now.</p><p>"The truth of the matter is, there's a whole betrayal going on. Families are <a href=#>divided and broken up</a>."</p><p>The source added: "Sister Wives&nbsp;started as bringing positive awareness to polygamy, not ruin this generation."&nbsp;</p><p>The U.S. Sun previously reported that despite the Brown's breakup, "it's not <a href=#>the end of Sister Wives</a>."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"They do have a multi-year&nbsp;contract," an insider alleged, "so they're going to have to figure out something.
