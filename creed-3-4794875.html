Jordan</strong> as Adonis “Donnie” Creed. Michael is also making his feature directorial debut with the film. His character is the illegitimate son of the late boxing world champion Apollo Creed, who was a rival of Rocky Balboa’s. He trains under Rocky in the first two films.</li><li><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Tessa Thompson</a>&nbsp;</strong>as Bianca Taylor. Bianca is Donnie’s fiancée and an aspiring musician. She wears hearing aids due to hearing loss. In&nbsp;Creed II, Bianca gets a music recording contract, but then discovers she’s pregnant. She gives birth to a baby girl named Amara who is born deaf.</li><li><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Phylicia Rashad</a>&nbsp;</strong>as Mary Anne Creed. Mary is Apollo’s widow who adopts Donnie in the first film. She’s initially unsupportive of his boxing career, but eventually she comes around to it.</li><li><strong>Wood Harris&nbsp;</strong>as Tony “Little Duke” Evers. Tony is Apollo and Rocky’s former trainer and an uncle-figure to Donnie. He eventually agrees to train Donnie in boxing.</li><li><strong>Florian Munteanu&nbsp;</strong>as Viktor Drago. Viktor is the son of Russian prize champion boxer Captain Ivan Drago. Viktor becomes Donnie’s rival in&nbsp;Creed II.</li><li><strong>Jonathan Majors&nbsp;</strong>as Damian. Damian is a new character who is Donnie’s boxing opponent in Creed III. In an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, Jonathan revealed he “got punched in the face about 100 times” during filming. Jonathan revealed that there are emotional reasons behind Dame’s physical transformation. “There are certain reasons you build your body. Dame’s body was built from loss,” Jonathan told <a href=# rel=nofollow>Men’s Health</a>. “He had lost something, and that hole is what made him work the way he worked. When you see Dame’s body, you go, Oh, that makes sense. You don’t look like that and be happy with life.”</li></ul><p id=content-paragraph-10><strong>Selenis Leyva, Thaddeus J. Mixson,&nbsp;Spence Moore II, </strong>and<strong> Mila&nbsp;Davis-Kent&nbsp;</strong>have also been cast in&nbsp;Creed III. Sadly,&nbsp;Sylvester Stallone will not be returning as Rocky Balboa, though he’s still on the producing team. Sylvester apparently decided on his own to not star in Creed III.&nbsp;Sylvester played Rocky in all six&nbsp;Rocky&nbsp;films and the first two&nbsp;Creed&nbsp;films.</p><h2>What’s The Storyline?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/everything-about-creed-3-mgm-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-11>The official synopsis for Creed III reads: After dominating the boxing world, Adonis Creed has been thriving in both his career and family life. When a childhood friend and former boxing prodigy, Damian, resurfaces after serving a long sentence in prison, he is eager to prove that he deserves his shot in the ring. The face-off between former friends is more than just a fight. To settle the score, Adonis must put his future on the line to battle Damian – a fighter who has nothing to lose.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/creed-iii-michael-b-jordan-update-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12>In an interview with U.K.’s <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Metro</a>, Sylvester said that the script for&nbsp;Creed III&nbsp;is “really interesting.” He also said, “It takes it in a different direction. I wish them well and keep punching!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Tessa has teased that the third film will focus more on Bianca and her relationship with Donnie. “We’ve been making these films for almost eight years, and Mike and I have grown up a lot,” Tessa previously told Hollywood Reporter in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>an interview</a>.&nbsp;“So there’s ways in which the trajectory of the characters also has an interesting sort of poetry to our own personal journeys in a lot of ways.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/everything-about-creed-3-mgm-embed2.jpg><h2>Who’s The Creative Team Behind Creed 3?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>Creed III&nbsp;will mark Michael B.
