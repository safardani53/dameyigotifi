My new movie Barbie opens.</p><p>“I had an incredible 12 hours working on this and can’t wait for you to see it.”</p><p>That’s even more than Love Island’s&nbsp;<a href=#>Chris Taylor</a>, who got&nbsp;<a href=#>cast as a Ken doll</a>&nbsp;because Margot is a big fan of the&nbsp;ITV2 dating series.</p><p>He is on screen for two seconds, uttering the line: “The Nobel Prize for horses goes to Ken.”</p><p>I doubt that Quentin Tarantino will be calling any time soon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rob-brydon-attends-european-premiere-831491478-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chris-taylor-attends-barbie-european-831322200.jpg><h2 class=has-text-align-center>ROB: I FEEL SO GOOD IN MY FORTIES</h2><p>ROBBIE WILLIAMS is happier than ever as he approaches his 50th birthday, but is still “teetering on anxiety and darkness”.</p><p><a href=#>The Rock DJ singer</a>, who is in the middle of a European tour and plays two sell-out dates on the Sandringham Estate next month, reckons becoming a father of four and marrying <a href=#>US actress Ayda Field</a> has given him a solid purpose in life away from his pop career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/robbie-williams-attends-party-hosted-820182129.jpg><p>But he still struggles with his mental health. Robbie said: “It’s an ongoing battle.</p><p>"I can tell you at 49, my forties have been my best decade mentally.</p><p>“It’s up and down. I suppose when I have nothing to do or no responsibilities other than being a dad and husband, I am kind of OK.</p><p>“And OK is an incredible place to reach. I am not asking for being at the top of any mountain or jumping for joy – being OK is mammoth.”</p><p>That said, Robbie admitted he still isn’t where he wants to be, despite shedding 4st and overhauling his lifestyle.</p><p>"Ahead of his milestone birthday in February, he said: “I’ve got my 50th coming up. Maybe there is a different way to be and do things.</p><p>“That gives me an idea for a TV programme...‘Robbie Williams Does Things Differently’ and I just give those things a go. I am constantly teetering on anxiety and darkness.</p><p>“It doesn’t take much to set me off so I desperately need eight hours of sleep and if I don’t get eight hours I’m not much use to anybody – no more so than myself.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>STAR HAS LOR OF NERVE</h2><p>TWO-TIME Eurovision winner Loreen only entered the annual singing contest to try to get over her stage fright.</p><p><a href=#>The Swedish star</a>, who triumphed in 2012 with Euphoria and this year with Tattoo, said she chucked herself in at the deep end and it has helped her become a better performer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-stage-grand-final-m-817342295.jpg><p>Speaking in a new Marie Claire ­magazine cover story, she explained: “I was afraid of standing on stage, so what did I do?</p><p>"I put myself in such a brutal situation. Can you imagine the fear of standing in front of millions of people?</p><p>“It was my hardest experience. I knew it was going to be painful – and it was throughout the whole performance.</p><p>“I was so afraid but I knew it was ­necessary, so I did it.</p><p>“After that, the fear was not completely gone, but I took it step by step, and it was necessary.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>EXEC HARL-Y KNOWS GAGA</h2><p>LADY GAGA insists on being called Lee on the set of Joker 2: Folie A Deux – which is thought to be short for the name of her character, Harley Quinn.</p><p><a href=#>The star</a>, known for being a fan of method acting, has left execs feeling a little unsettled with her demand.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lady-gaga-seen-filming-joker-805528542.jpg><p>In fact the film’s cinematographer, Larry Sher, says he feels like he’s “never really met” the singer.</p><p>Revealing he felt the on-set dynamic shift after Gaga made the name request, he told the Talking Trenches TV podcast: “Everything changed.
