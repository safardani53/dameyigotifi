We would love to do it.”</p><p>The desire for a sequel to the 1997 film — which turns 25 next month — reached a fever pitch in February, when Sorvino reunited with her Romy and Michele costar <a href=#><strong>Lisa Kudrow</strong> </a>to present at the 2022 SAG Awards. The actresses were not only <a href=#>dressed like their characters</a>, they also riffed on several quotes from the movie and walked out to their reunion slow dance song, <a href=#><strong>Cyndi Lauper</strong></a>’s “Time After Time.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/25-Things-You-Dont-Know-About-Mira-Sorvino3.jpg><p>After starring in countless movies and shows <a href=#>throughout the ’90s and 2000s</a> — including films Summer of Sam and Mimic and TV series including Impeachment: American Crime Story and Modern Family — the New Jersey native currently acts opposite Kudrow’s Friends costar <a href=#><strong>Courteney Cox</strong></a> in Shining Vale.</p><p>The actress caught up with Us in March, revealing 25 things you don’t know about her, including the reason why Romy is her favorite character — and which Italian location is her dream getaway.</p><p>Scroll down for more exclusive facts about Sorvino:</p><p>1. I think Capri is Eden. I’m intoxicated by this most beautiful, delicious Italian island with its azure waters and radiant grottos.</p><p>2. My favorite song right now is “Lemon” by Local Natives with <strong>Sharon Van Etten</strong>. It captures the melancholy of this distance we’ve all felt from each other [amid the COVID-19 pandemic].</p><p>3. I love watching my kids perform. My oldest girl, Mattea, is a serious dancer/choreographer, my sons, Johnny and Holden, wow on the baseball field, and my 9-year old [daughter], Lucia, is fearless with a song and a mic.</p><p>4. People love to come up to me and say, “I’m the Mary!” from Romy and Michele’s High School Reunion.</p><p>5. Romy was my favorite role because it was so fun and authentic to my memories of high school.</p><p>6. I also loved my role as a bipolar Italian girl with a secret in Union Square. She was crazy like a fox!</p><p>7. Wizard of Oz was the first movie I saw. I was holding my breath for what seemed like half an hour once the winged monkeys came on the scene.</p><p>8. I love horses. I was an owner and hunter jumper, now I’m in equine therapy.</p><p>9. I have a small but powerful group of best friends with whom I share life’s joys, humor and sorrows.</p><p>10. Sometimes I express political or social justice-related thoughts on Twitter. People like to tell actors to shut up, to which I like to answer, “It’s still a free country!”</p><p>11. Weekends are spent with my family on the beach and eating together at a big table. Then it’s game or movie night.</p><p>12. My pet peeves are cruelty, prejudice and shallowness.</p><p>13. I’m addicted to social media — like everyone else!</p><p>14. Babysitting was my very first job.</p><p>15. I was once a waitress to an incredibly rude customer who treated me like an object and then told me, “Dismissed!” I quit that night, not before giving him what for!</p><p>16. My longest band love is Squeeze. I’ve been to a few of their concerts recently, and they still sound incredible!</p><p>17. I can’t get enough of What We Do in the Shadows and Catastrophe by <strong>Sharon Horgan</strong>, who happens to be cocreator of my new show, Shining Vale.</p><p>18. My first concert was Adam and the Ants with INXS opening up for them.</p><p>19. I love the book The Catcher in the Rye so much that my son is named Holden [after the main character].</p><p>20. I love the margaritas and Bellinis from Harry’s Bar in Venice, Italy.</p><p>21. We hope to go to Norway and Sweden this summer so my kids and husband can explore the land of their Viking roots.</p><p>22. I pick my nails when I’m nervous.</p><p>23. I am literally joyous on the set of Shining Vale because of all the creativity, humor and kindness of my costars.</p><p>24. I hate the obsession with self-alteration on Instagram. Everyone ends up looking the same, like an alien Barbie or something.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>25. I love spaghetti with my home-cooked fresh tomato marinara [made] with tomatoes and basil from my garden.</p><p>See Sorvino in Shining Vale Sundays on STARZ.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGamoaKWerS70a%2Bgp6ddZ4JuwMeipaCrXa68tnnDqKWtZZujvLh5wJumrqxdorJufo4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./erik-petersen-suicide-mischief-brew-lead-singer-dead.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mischief Brew Lead Singer Killed Himself, Police Confirm Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kameiro-rush-20091124-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kameiro Rush (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
