As the ladies sit in front of the TV, they tune in to watch Whoopi as Rod Sterling on The Twilight Zone, who announces that the women are all dressing as TV characters for Halloween, on Monday, October 31. The black-and-white sketch was a total throwback to anyone who grew up on the TV classics. After the sketch, the women were cut into the opening credits for the shows that their characters were taken from, which were shared on the show’s <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Twitter</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/the-view-halloween-morning-show-costume-2022-embed4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Whil<span>e she was shown last, Whoopi had an incredibly powerful costume, dressed as one of the women in Gilead from </span>The Handmaid’s Tale&nbsp;<span>for her costume. She had a powerful pro-choice message printed on the back of the classic red robe, shown before she entered the set. ” My body, my morals, my life, my choice. Not yours,” the costume said.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/the-view-halloween-morning-show-costume-2022-embed3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>With Alyssa’s first Halloween on the show, she paid tribute to one of her favorite TV shows&nbsp;Sex And The City,&nbsp;and she said that&nbsp;<strong>Sarah Jessica Parker’s&nbsp;</strong>Carrie Bradshaw is one of her favorite characters of all time. She stunned in a pink dress with a curly blonde wig. “When Sex and the City&nbsp;first premiered, I was actually not allowed to watch it, but I’d sneak to my best friend’s house and watch it,” she said. “I was always a Carrie. I wanted to be her: the style, the fashion, the whole thing.” She later changed into Carrie’s wedding dress later in the show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/the-view-halloween-morning-show-costume-2022-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Sunny wore an elegant gown and a large wig, fit for royalty. She revealed that she wanted to pay tribute to the historical figure that Queen Charlotte on Bridgerton was based on, and <strong>Golda Rosheuvel </strong>even sent her a special video message. “I love Bridgerton.&nbsp;I love the Duke especially, and the Queen’s character. She’s actually based on a historically-accurate figure, Queen Charlotte, who was biracial, and I just thought, what better way to pay homage to that queen than to try to duplicate it?” she said. Sunny had some costume changes during the show, giving different royal looks.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Sara did her best&nbsp;<strong>Catherine O’Hara&nbsp;</strong>impression, dressed as the actress’s character Moira Rose on the show. She rocked a black wig and sported a leather catsuit. While she did the accent in the sketch, Sara promised not to do it the whole show, but she admitted to being a huge fan of the show “Catherine O’Hara’s a comedic genius,” she said. Sara also had some outfit changes, inspired by Moira’s different outfits.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Joy went for an older sitcom, as Peggy Bundy from&nbsp;Married With Children. She rocked a huge wig (which she said was part of why she wanted to wear the costume), and a pair of leggings and a pink top. “I like the wig. She also was opinionated, outspoken. She was brutally honest. She spoke her mind. I admire that in any woman,” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/the-view-halloween-morning-show-costume-2022-embed5.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>Ana dressed as the iconic singer and actress <strong>Charo, </strong>who famously sang the theme for The Love Boat, and she cited the classic show as inspiring for her as a young girl, but she was interrupted by a surprise appearance from Charo herself! “Imagine being a little immigrant girl, who comes here and gets to see a Hispanic woman on TV with an accent,” she said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>The 71-year-old singer was so energetic, and she wore her original costume for the surprise appearance on&nbsp;The View. Ana pointed out that Charo was wearing the original Love Boat&nbsp;costume to the audience. She had the hosts in stitches with some great jokes. Before going to the commercial break, Charo sang them out with a flamenco guitar. The singer also revealed that she’s a huge fan of the show. “I love you all. I watch your show. You can change the world with a snap of the finger,” she said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>The women were also joined by <strong>Randall Park </strong>and<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;</a><strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Aubrey Plaza</a>&nbsp;</strong>to celebrate Halloween. In reference to his recent&nbsp;Blockbuster TV show, Randall dressed as his character, who’s a manager at the video store chain. The actress, who’s no stranger to horror after starring in the 2019 Child’s Play&nbsp;remake looked amazing in a sexy witch costume. When Aubrey joined the ladies, she jokingly called out for Joy for her recent claims that she’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>had sex with ghosts</a> on the show. “I have a score to settle with you,” Aubrey said, as she pointed at Joy. “You had sex with my ghost, and that was&nbsp;my&nbsp;ghost!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Before their costumes, the ladies have already been getting into the Halloween spirit with some spooky hot topic discussions earlier this month. During a chat about ghosts, Joy let a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>terrifying secret slip.</a> “I’ve had sex with a few ghosts and never got pregnant,” she joked.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>The costumes were very different from their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>looks from last year,</a> where all the ladies paid tribute to some of their favorite musicals of all time. They had a full-blown “Viewsical,” complete with their own opening number, which interpolated parts from so many classic showtunes. Whoopi went the most over-the-top with a full-blown Audrey II outfit from Little Shop of Horrors,&nbsp;but her co-stars went for more screen-oriented movie musicals. Joy went as Magenta from&nbsp;The Rocky Horror Picture Show.&nbsp;The other ladies took inspiration from major actresses who starred in musicals, like Ana as Eva Peron from Evita&nbsp;(who was played by <strong>Madonna</strong>), Sara as&nbsp;<strong>Nicole Kidman’s&nbsp;</strong>character from&nbsp;Moulin Rouge,&nbsp;and Sunny taking page from&nbsp;<strong>Beyonce’s&nbsp;</strong>book as Dreamgirls’&nbsp;Deena Jones.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>The women on&nbsp;The View&nbsp;do tend to pick a theme and stick with it! Back in 2019, the ladies all took inspiration from classic <strong>Stephen King&nbsp;</strong>books and movies and had some really scary costumes! The show featured Whoopi as the&nbsp;Pet Sematary&nbsp;cat Church, Sunny as the terrifying clown Pennywise from&nbsp;It,&nbsp;and Joy teamed up with ex-host&nbsp;<strong>Meghan McCain&nbsp;</strong>to be the Grady Twins from&nbsp;The Shining.&nbsp;Former host&nbsp;<strong>Abby Huntsman&nbsp;</strong>dressed as Carrie from the novel of the same name.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>The year before that, the women were a little less cohesive, with the theme being strong women. As the ladies chose their own costumes, it was a unique chance to see each of the co-hosts own personalities. Whoopi went as Vampirina from the children’s cartoon, while Sunny celebrated&nbsp;Black Panther’s&nbsp;Okoye (has anyone asked if she’s seen&nbsp;Black Panther: Wakanda Forever&nbsp;yet?), and Joy got creative as the “Midterm-inator,” which was inspired by&nbsp;<strong>Arnold Schwarzenegger’s </strong>famous&nbsp;Terminator.&nbsp;The show’s co-hosts Abby and Meghan, who have since left the program, went as&nbsp;<strong>Lady Gaga&nbsp;</strong>(in three different outfits inspired by the “Poker Face” singer), and Elsa from&nbsp;Frozen,&nbsp;respectively.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5JqZq2glWLDqrHWZp%2BapJykxKaxzWaaqKukqrqmv4xrZ2tqXZ28tMDSZqehp6SkwHA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-jamal-adams-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Jamal Adams Dating Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pregnant-hannah-ferrier-slams-troll-telling-her-to-be-full-time-mom.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Pregnant Hannah Ferrier Slams Troll Telling Her to Be Full-Time' Mom</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
