Since then, it's only grown in popularity, and many users have taken advantage of the Stories feature to offer snippets of their life, promote products or services, or do whatever else they may be interested in. Now, a problem with the Stories feature has led many Instagram users to be disgruntled with the platform.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why does Instagram say there's no music available?</h2><p>One feature of Stories that users seem to love is the ability to add music to their story. Now, that feature is not working for some users, and it's leading to widespread frustration. Users have been posting about their issues using music for several days now, and the lack of resolution from <a href=#>Instagram</a> has only increased many users' feelings of frustration.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Many users are posting about searching for songs through Stories and getting no results. Some users have even tried to uninstall and reinstall the app, or restart their phone, and they haven't had any success in getting music back.</p><p>"Hello <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@instagram</a> , My account music section is not working," one user wrote. "They show No Results Found. Please solve my problem immediately."</p><p>"What the hell <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@instagram</a>!!! Music on Story is not working. It shows ‘No Results Found’ when a song is searched. Tried to uninstall/reinstall, update and restart," another <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">person added</a>.</p><p>"<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@instagram</a> music is not working on Stories on a personal account," a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">third wrote</a>. "Have tried everything. Still showing no results found. And <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">#Instagram</a> is not even resolving the issue. Worst app!"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Business accounts are not allowed to add music to stories.</h2><p>Instagram has long prohibited businesses from adding music to their stories because of concerns over copyright violations, but many users are now reporting that the issue is affecting their personal accounts as well. Instagram has yet to address the issue or explain why so many personal accounts are without access to music on Stories. Given how long the problem has already gone on for, it's also not clear when it will be resolved.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">There are some fixes which may bring music back for you.</h2><p>Although many users have found that every trick they try fails, the issue seems to vary from person to person, so it's possible that these tricks may work for you:</p><ul><li>Make sure you're using the latest version of the app.</li><li>Log out and then back into the app.</li></ul><ul><li>Delete and re-install the app.</li><li>Switch to a personal account if you also have a business account.</li></ul><p>If none of these tricks work for you, it's likely that you'll just have to wait for Instagram to address the problem more directly. Given how slow they've been thus far, there's plenty of reasons to be pessimistic about how long it will take for them to fully restore the music feature. Instagram and its parent company Facebook have been in the headlines recently for even more serious problems, so it's possible that this just isn't at the top of their priority list.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOonKxlmaPAta3Gq5imZaOWxm66zmakrquZmHqiwsCio5qanJo%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./marko-simovic.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Marko Simovic</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./michael-pitts-pastor.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Michael Pitts (pastor) net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
