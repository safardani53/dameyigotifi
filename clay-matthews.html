The plot twist is that the team’s defensive coordinator was his father, Clay Matthews Jr.&nbsp;</p><p>Even so, Matthews Jr. didn’t allow his son to start due to his physic. After his senior year, he vastly had a boost in his size.</p><p>Due to him not seeing any playtime in high school, he was not hyped during that time.

Furthermore, his father and uncle both went to the same university.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Clay-Matthews-College.jpeg><p>Not to mention, his father was a USC Hall of Famer.
