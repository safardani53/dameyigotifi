I went round there to wake him up and he was just gone, lying peacefully in bed.</p><p>“We don’t know what happened yet. Everything had been very complicated recently, but George was looking forward to Christmas, and so was I.”</p><p>He later tweeted: "It's an Xmas I will never forget finding your partner dead peacefully in bed first thing in the morning... I will never stop missing you xx"</p><p>It has emerged that Fawaz slept in his car on the night of George Michael's death, despite originally claiming he spent the entire weekend at the star's house.</p><p>The 49-year-old now insists the pair spent the night apart and he discovered his lifeless body the next day.</p><h2>What was Fadi Fawaz's 999 call after he found George Michael?</h2><p>A dramatic leaked 999 call from Fawaz after he discovered Michael's body reveals he spent nearly an hour trying to wake the star before phoning for an ambulance.</p><p>Fadi is heard explaining: “I’ve been trying to wake him up for the last hour but it was not possible.</p><p>“He’s gone. He’s blue. He’s gone.”</p><p>The handler then asks where George’s body is and Fadi replies: “He’s in bed. Dead. He’s cold and he’s blue... yes, he’s very stiff. He’s dead... he’s dead.”</p><p>Asked by the operator if the singer is “beyond help”, Fadi reveals he has spent an hour trying to revive him.</p><p>The operator goes on to ask if George’s death was “expected”.</p><p>Fadi replies: “No, no, no, no, no, no, I’ve been waiting for him to wake him up for like, you know, for hours and he wouldn’t wake up, I went to wake him up and he was gone, you know, he’s not there.”</p><p>He adds: “It’s George Michael, you know, the singer?”</p><p>Fadi then wrongly gives George’s date of birth as July 25 instead of June 25.</p><p>The operator tells him the ambulance is on its way and not to move the body in the meantime before she hangs up.</p><p>In a statement, the star's publicist said: "It is with great sadness that we can confirm our beloved son, brother and friend George passed away peacefully at home over the Christmas period. The family would ask that their privacy be respected at this difficult and emotional time. There will be no further comment at this stage."</p><h2>What has Fadi said about George's death?</h2><p>After George's cause of death was revealed by the senior Oxfordshire coroner on March 7, 2017 Fadi tweeted: "F*** YOU" followed by a tweet with a picture of the two captioned: "The Truth is out..."</p><p>Following George's death, Fadi posted a link to a previously unreleased track by the singer, entitled "This Kind of Love", believed to be from the 'lost' album Trojan Souls.</p><p>His post&nbsp;prompted a legal row after many called for it to be officially released – with lawyers for George's estate calling for it be taken down, citing intellectual property rights.</p><p>Fadi said his Twitter account was hacked after posts seemingly written by him claimed George had "tried to kill himself many times" and "finally managed" it.</p><p>However, George's friends, who claim Fadi is a "leech" and actually split from him in 2015, have raised questions about the singer's final hours.</p><p>In May 2017, The Sun on Sunday revealed George’s former lover had demanded a multi-million-pound pay-out from the popstar’s fortune.</p><p>The <a href=#>49-year-old was seeking maintenance for the lifestyle</a> to which he became accustomed during the couple’s seven-year relationship.</p><p>Fadi has claimed in emails seen by The Sun that George took his own life on Christmas Eve and that it was the singer's fifth suicide attempt, despite the coroner's conclusion that he died of natural causes.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Read More in The Sun</h2></p><p>He made the claims after saying he was "sick and tired of people asking me what happened on Christmas Day".</p><p>In August 2018, Fadi tweeted "George I hate you" before posting another tweet appearing to repeat his claims that George took his own life although the senior coroner said that the pop legend died of natural causes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hqYGeBdX%2BWaJ2anJlis6LDwLNkoJ2fp7SmecyimqGZlaF6o7vYn6minZ6ZeqWxwK2faA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-lindsey-davis-abc-husband-paul-roberts.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Linsey Davis' husband, Paul Roberts?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dr-guddi-singh-your-body-uncovered.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Dr Guddi Singh?
