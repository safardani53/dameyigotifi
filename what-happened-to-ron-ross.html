Ron was known for interviewing celebrity guests, and while he survived at Sirius XM for more than a decade, many are now wondering what happened to the radio host, and why his show seems to have disappeared completely in recent weeks.</p><p>So, what exactly happened?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Ron Ross?</h2><p>Earlier this month, Ron Ross broke the news on his Twitter page that he had been laid off from Sirius XM after 16 years with the company.</p><p>"Welp, I survived a merger, a heart attack, and a global pandemic, but after nearly 16 years, it’s over. I was laid off from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@SiriusXM</a> yesterday in their purge. No more <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">#RonRossMorningShow</a>. Thank you, thank you, thank you for welcoming me into your mornings. We had some fun didn’t we?" he wrote at the time.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>That tweet was from March 7, and since then, Ron has been relatively quiet on social media. Ron was one of many people cut at Sirius XM in early March, when the company announced that it would be laying off about 475 people, or roughly 8% of its total workforce. Those layoffs came as many media companies were making similar moves after advertising cash began to dry up in response to economic uncertainty.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>@SIRIUSXM</a> I'm so sad that you cancelled Ron Ross on the Pulse. He was such a great DJ & a joy to listen to during my morning commutes. My motivation to continue my siriusxm subscription just went to 0. Sadly, greed is killing this company and I don't want to be a part of it.</p>— mikefly562 (@mikefly562) <a href=#>March 29, 2023</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fans were unhappy about Ron's layoff.</h2><p>In response to his tweet, hundreds of fans weighed in to express disappointment about Sirius's move.</p><p>"My commute in the morning is over 1.5 hours, but yet I looked forward to it because of your morning show. I am so sad to hear it's over. It was awesome," one person wrote.</p><p>"So sad to see this! My morning commute hasn’t been the same. Best of luck to you," another person added.</p><p>To his credit, Ron's response to these comments has been largely positive, and he is expressing gratitude for all the time he was able to spend hosting his show. Even his own daughter weighed in, writing that she didn't realize how lucky she was to be able to listen her father every day.</p><p>"Being able to hear my dad on the air on any given morning was a blessing I took for granted. On to bigger and better things," she wrote in response to his tweet.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Welp, I survived a merger, a heart attack, and a global pandemic but after nearly 16 years it’s over.

He has not tweeted out any news about where he might land, but it seems like he has the kind of experience that could land him in a plum job, even if it is in a more localized market.</p><p>Wherever Ron ends up, he'll have a dedicated set of supporters there waiting to listen to him talk with his guests. Of course, this difficult market environment means that it's not exactly a boom time for radio. Maybe Ron could consider launching his own podcast instead. That market's definitely not over-saturated.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSrp55iv7C%2F0g%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-did-reading-rainbow-get-canceled.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'Reading Rainbow' Was Canceled After 26 Years Due to This Sad Reason</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./teen-mom-2-tots-my-how-theyve-grown-2011172.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Teen Mom 2 Tots: My, How They've Grown!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
