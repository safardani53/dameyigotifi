data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>joked about killing Christy</a> during an interview from July 2013.</p><h3>Christy Mack Attack: Dog The Bounty Hunter Seeking MMA’s War Machine</h3><p id=content-paragraph-5>On Aug. 11, Christy took to Twitter to share her emotional statement and the graphic images of her beaten body.</p><h3>Christy Mack: MMA Ex Made Rape Joke Months Before Alleged&nbsp;Attack</h3><p id=paragraph2 class=pgh-paragraph>At around 2 am Friday morning, Jon Koppenhaver arrived unannounced to my home in Las Vegas, NV, after he broke up with me in May, he moved out of my house and back to San Diego. When he arrived, he found myself and one other fully clothed and unarmed in the house. Without a single word spoken, he began beating my friend; once he was finished, he sent my friend away and turned his attention to me. He made me undress and shower in front of him, then dragged me out and beat my face. I have no recollection of how many times I was hit, I just know my injuries that resulted from my beating.</p><p id=paragraph3 class=pgh-paragraph>My injuries include 18 broken bones around my eyes, my nose is broken in 2 places, I am missing teeth and several more are broken. I am unable to chew, or see out of my left eye. My speech is slurred from my swelling and lack of teeth. I have a fractured rib and severely ruptured liver from a kick to my side. My leg is so badly injured I have not been able to walk on my own. I also attained several lesions from a knife he got from my kitchen. He pushed the knife into me in some areas such as my hand, ear, and head. He also sawed much of my hair off with this dull knife. After some time, the knife broke off of the handle and continued to threaten me with the blade. I believed I was going to die. He has beaten me many times before, but never this badly.</p><p id=paragraph4 class=pgh-paragraph>He took my phone and cancelled all of my plans for the following week to make sure no one would worry about my whereabouts. He told me he was going to rape me, but was disappointed in himself when he could not get hard. After another hit or two, he left me on the floor bleeding and shaking, holding my side from the pain of my rib. He left the room and went to the kitchen where I could hear him ruffling through my drawers. Assuming he was finding a sharper, more stable knife to end my life, I ran out my back door, shutting it behind me so the dogs didn’t run inside to tip him off. I hopped the fence to the golf course behind my house and ran to a neighboring house. Naked and afraid he would catch me, I kept running through the neighborhood knocking on doors. Finally, one answered and I was brought to the hospital and treated for my injuries.</p><p id=paragraph5 class=pgh-paragraph>I would like to thank everyone for their support through this rough time. I am healing fast and well, and I appreciate all of the prayers and visits I have received over the past few days. After many months of fear and pressure to keep this man happy, although I fear for my life, I feel that I can no longer put myself in this situation. The cheating by him nearly every day, and almost weekly abuse is now more than I can stand. There is a $10k reward for the capture of Jonathan Koppenhaver at this time. Please report any information to your local police.</p><p id=paragraph6 class=pgh-paragraph>Thank you.</p><p id=paragraph7 class=pgh-paragraph>-Christy Mack</p><p class=pgh-paragraph>Christy, an adult film actress, frequently worked with Fleshlight, a sex toy company. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>They are offering a $5,000 reward</a> for “any information that leads to his apprehension and arrest.”</p><p class=pgh-paragraph>War Machine released a Twitter statement of his own, telling his 58 thousand followers that he had actually gone to her house to surprise her with an engagement ring.</p><p class=pgh-paragraph>“I’m not a bad guy, I went to surprise my gf, help her set up her show and to give her an engagement ring and ended up fighting for my life,” he wrote on August 10. The rest of his statement followed in a series of tweets:</p><p class=pgh-paragraph>“The cops will never give me fair play, never believe me. Still deciding what to do but at the end of the day it’s all just heart breaking.&nbsp;I only wish that man hadn’t been there and that Christy & I would behappily engaged.I don’t know y I’m so cursed.One day truth will come out.”</p><h3>War Machine’s Mug Shot Revealed After Alleged Christy Mack&nbsp;Attack</h3><p class=pgh-paragraph><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>He tweeted directly at Christy Mack</a>, as well, with the following message (pasted together for clarity):</p><p class=pgh-paragraph>“love you and hope you’re okay. I came him early to surprise you and help you set up for your convention. I can’t believe what I found and can’t believe what happened. All I wanted was to surprise you and help and do something nice…now this.. I’m so heart broken…in all ways. I will always love you.&nbsp;I just wanted to see your face when I surprised you with the ring …this is a nightmare. You’re in my thoughts.”</p><p class=pgh-paragraph>His story seems fairly unlikely, and his bosses appear to agree; War Machine has been released from his contract with MMA tournament group Bellator.</p><p class=pgh-paragraph>“We have a zero tolerance policy here at Bellator when it relates to any form of domestic violence,” Bellator president <strong>Scott Coker</strong> told TMZ.&nbsp;“After learning of this latest incident involving (Jon Koppenhaver) War Machine, Bellator is releasing him from his promotional contract with the organization.”</p><p class=pgh-paragraph>Our <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>thoughts go out to Christy during this scary time</a> and we hope that her attacker&nbsp;will soon be brought to justice.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>—&nbsp;Emily Longeretta</strong></p><h3>More Scary&nbsp;News:</h3><li>Teen Girl, 16, Killed: Run Over By Boat In Horrific Tubing Accident</li><li>Mike Brown: St. Louis Police Shoot & Kill Unarmed 18-Year-Old — So Sad</li><li>Parents Jailed For Starving Boy, 7, To ‘Walking Skeleton’: Court Applauds</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlkZH15e5BrZpygop7AtcWMppico12Wr7a%2FxGanopujYsSivoymmJygmaOybq3LpZygnZRis6qzx61m</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./allonzo-trier.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Allonzo Trier [2023 Update]: Drug Test, NBA &amp;amp; Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./roy-cohn.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Roy Cohn</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
