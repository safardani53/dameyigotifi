By the age of 23, Matt had run 1700 miles of Pacific Crest Trail in 58 days.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Matt lives in remote Utah, away from mainstream civilization, in the primitive shelters. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h3><strong>Matt Graham's Expertise On Survival Earned Him Massive Net Worth</strong></h3><p>Matt’s survival skills eventually earned him fame and net worth, when he was cast to replace Cody Lundin, in Discovery Channel’s survival-themed reality series, Dual Survival. Matt first appeared as the mid-season replacement for Lundin in the fourth season of the&nbsp;Dual Survival, but then went on to star in the next two seasons. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Prior to the Dual Survival, Matt had starred in another survival show of the Discovery Channel, Dude, You’re Screwed.

Well into his middle age, Matt seems more in love with the wild and the dangers lurking within it, than to a wife or the idea of peaceful married life.</p><p>However, it is equally possible that he might actually have a wife but respects his and his wife's privacy too much to showcase&nbsp;their married life in public. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Keep Reading:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# title="Coyote Peterson Wiki: Behind Adventure, Who Is Wife Of Wilderness Star?" rel=follow>Coyote Peterson Wiki: Behind Adventure, Who Is Wife Of Wilderness Star?</a></p><p>Regardless of whether Matt is married or not, he is as much in love with wilderness as with his possible wife, if not more, and it does show in the dedication he puts into teaching survival skills in and outside TV shows.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGianqSVl8BwucCtq2afopa1ormMnayapF2owrPCyK%2BYpWWnnrOmecyaqauhlZl7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sona-jobarteh.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Sona Jobarteh net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-pablo-alboran-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Pablo Alborn Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
