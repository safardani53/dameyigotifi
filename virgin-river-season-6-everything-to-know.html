For the five subsequent seasons, viewers have watched the character fall in love, get engaged, face a pregnancy loss and discover the identity of her biological father. The rest of the town, meanwhile, has dealt with surprise pregnancies, natural disasters and a massive drug ring — something Smith said will take a backseat for season 6.</p><p>“I think probably moving forward, the drug story engines will kind of fall to the wayside a little bit, which always did feel more extreme,” he explained to THR. “I appreciate it, especially in the first season. … But it did feel like it was starting to overtake the show a little bit, and when you’re dealing with bigger physical stakes like that.”</p><p>Smith, who took over as showrunner from <strong>Sue Tenney</strong> before season 5, explained that he never had the “intention” of making sure season 6 <a href=#>matched the “intensity”</a> of the ones before it. Instead, he hopes to explore more of Mel and Jack’s (<strong>Martin Henderson</strong>) romance, deal with Jack’s PTSD, learn more about Doc’s (<strong>Tim Matheson</strong>) prognosis and see where the romantic future lies for the rest of Virgin River’s major players.</p><p>Keep scrolling for everything to know about Virgin River season 6:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Everything-to-Know-About-Virgin-River-Season-6-Cast-Release-Date-and-More-905.jpg><h3>When Does Production on ‘Virgin River’ Season 6 Start?</h3><p>The first half of season 6’s scripts were completed when the WGA went on strike in May 2023.
