The TikTok stars had dated briefly in 2020 and parted in May 2020.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Just months before their surprising breakup, the pair were involved in a cheating scandal. Their TikTok&nbsp;followers pointed out that Presley was cheating on Ziegler.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>But the social media personality dismissed the accusation, defending her then-beau through a&nbsp;social media post. She wrote,&nbsp;"All of these girls are trying to say Isaak cheated on me when HE’S WITH ME EVERY DAY." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The 17-year-old also asked for privacy and stated how the stuff wasn't anyone's business. Despite denying the cheating scandal, Ziegler and&nbsp;Presley broke up in May 2020.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Right after the breakup, Presley <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">uploaded a video</a> and weighed in on the cheating allegations. First, he denied cheating on&nbsp;Ziegler, mentioning that&nbsp;outsiders only see a specific layer of reality.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Then, touching down on their breakup, the <a href=# rel=follow>social media influencer</a> remarked he didn't leave his girlfriend for The Clubhouse. Instead, he announced his love for her and stated he had no negative thing to say on the matter. He added, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Sometimes when people break up, it doesn’t really have to do with they had bad blood, it’s just sometimes timing doesn’t work out.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>After the separation, Ziegler started dating fellow TikToker&nbsp;Tacoda Dubbs in August 2020, whereas&nbsp;Presley moved on with&nbsp;Carson Tiffany. And for a moment, everything seemed to run smoothly. However, there was more drama on the way.</p><h2>Mackenzie Ziegler Confirmed Presley's Cheating</h2><p>Ziegler broke silence on the cheating scandal months after their breakup when Presley's new girlfriend Tiffany accused him of cheating.</p><p>In December 2020, Tiffany <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">took to Instagram stories</a> to reveal she had broken up with Presley after knowing he cheated on her. In the wake of the shocking revelation, Ziegler fueled the drama, writing "Oh my God" and "Boys suck" in the response.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The former Dance Moms&nbsp;star also acknowledged the&nbsp;previous <a href=# rel=follow>cheating scandal</a> and recounted, "He still won’t admit that he cheated on me tho."</p><p>At the moment, Presley didn't respond to the accusations and let the drama pass.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Drama Resurfaced&nbsp;</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>On August 22, 2021,&nbsp;Ziegler again brought up the past cheating scandal through a TikTok video. The Pennsylvania native uploaded lip-sync to the phrase "What did I ever do to you?" and added a note, suggesting all exes say that.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>As soon as the video started making rounds on the internet, her followers believed she was throwing a dig at Presley. One TikTok quickly commented, "When you dated Isaac?" with skull emoji.</p><p>To everyone's surprise,&nbsp;Ziegler sarcastically replied, "Wait who?"&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>An Instagram page named the TikTok Insiders shared her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">mocking response in a post</a>. And without hesitation, Presley responded to the satire in the comment section.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>In his first comment, the 19-year-old stated they were on friendly terms even after their split and then noted how crazy it was that he suddenly did something wrong.</p><p>Then, in the second comment, Presley stated he had never said anything negative about Ziegler.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Mentioning that they had greeted each other when they met on August 11, the California native also cited that the drama was unnecessary.</p><p>At the end of his comment, he wrote, "TBH, I&nbsp;wish her nothing but the best." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Ziegler's now-boyfriend, Tacoda Dubbs, spoke&nbsp;his mind on Presley's reply, commenting Ziegler had every right to speak up on the matter.</p><p>The reply, apparently, angered Presley. He <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">instantly responded</a>, asking Dubbs not to talk about loyalty. After that, the Stuck In The Middle star exposed&nbsp;Dubbs for stalking his ex-girlfriend Raelynn.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>He ended his comment, saying, "I wish you two the best let's leave it at that."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In the light of the budding scandal, Presley's ex&nbsp;Tiffany also joined in the drama. She blasted Presley for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">playing the victim</a>&nbsp;while stating it hurt to watch the spectacle unfold.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKGjlq6sec%2BrnKykla56pLTEmquippdiwKStzZ2YpWaYqbqt</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gregg-hurwitz.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Gregg Hurwitz net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./vincent-regan.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Vincent Regan net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
