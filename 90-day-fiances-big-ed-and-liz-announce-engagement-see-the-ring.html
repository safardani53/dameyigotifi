Now, the couple is <a href=#>verifying their relationship status</a>.</p><p>“We are each other’s forever, and, yes, we are engaged!” the pair said in a statement to Us on Wednesday, November 10.</p><p>In photos, Liz and her fiancé showed off her diamond ring.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/90-Day-Fiances-Ed-Big-Ed-Brown-and-Liz-Woods-Announce-Their-Engagement-02.jpg><p><a href=#>Ed and Liz’s love story</a> was first documented on the 90 Day Fiancé spinoff, <a href=#>90 Day: The Single Life</a>, which aired earlier this year. In May, he opened up exclusively to Us about taking their relationship to the next level.</p><p>“I was elated [by] the fact that Liz wanted to move in,” the photographer said at the time. “The fact of the matter is, I wanted us to get to know each other more before I put a ring on her finger, so I really wanted to make sure that we were compatible.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/90-Day-Fiances-Ed-Big-Ed-Brown-and-Liz-Woods-Announce-Their-Engagement-01.jpg><p>However, Ed, who was previously married to ex-wife <strong>Sandra</strong>, revealed <a href=#>he and Liz were “in a rough spot</a> right now and we’re kind of working through [it].”</p><p>He added, “A relationship is hard, and she got out of her last relationship recently. I think she was only single for about two weeks before her and I started dating. So I think for Liz, it was a lot too fast.”</p><p>Still, the 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 4 alum, who <a href=#>previously dated <strong>Rosemarie “Rose” Vega</strong></a>, was committed to making things work with Liz.</p><p>“When she told me that she loved me, I mean, I already knew I was in love with her,” he told Us in May. “But to hear it from her for the first time, it really solidified my heart and the feelings that I have for her and her daughter,” whom she shares with an ex.</p><p>Later that same month, Ed and the restaurant manager revealed that they had split during the<a href=#> 90 Day: Single Life tell-all</a>. “Liz is somebody that I cared for and loved very much, and she wasn’t wrong,” he said at the time. “She was just the wrong one.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/90-Day-Fiances-Ed-Big-Ed-Brown-and-Liz-Woods-Announce-Their-Engagement-Inline.jpg><p>During the episode, the twosome admitted they had moved too fast — but were able to reconnect in the months leading up to their engagement.
