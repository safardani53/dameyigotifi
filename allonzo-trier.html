Unfortunately, not much is not revealed when it comes to Trier’s father.</p><p>Nonetheless, Trier started playing basketball when he was seven years old. Trier used to play basketball with players older and more robust than him from a young age.&nbsp;</p><p>In the eighth, Trier dropped out of his varsity team for being too good for his teammates.</p><p>Since his childhood, Trier has had a special bond and perfect sync with her mother.&nbsp;</p><p>Without his mother, Allonzo would not be the player he is today. Trier’s mother has sacrificed a lot, and she deserves every respect.</p><p>Marcie encouraged and supported him with everything to fulfill his dream of being a basketball player. She attended all of his basketball games and training since his childhood.</p><h3>Training Routine</h3><p>After working early shifts, Marcie used to get home for Trier training sessions. Marcie used to rebound and tally the shots Trier scored.</p><p>In the gym, Trier made 500 shots every day from different spots starting from short to midrange, then finally 3-point line.</p><p>When Trier misses two shots in a row during training, she then will deduct one point from the total. After that, Marcie would drive Trier to another gym nearby.</p><p>Trier practiced with the local high school for a one-hour workout like ball-handling, shooting, and energetic one-on-one basketball.</p><p>Trier used to follow these workouts twice a week.
