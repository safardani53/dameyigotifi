Miguel Angelo Falco de Oliveira is a professional motorcycle racer from Portugal who competes in the MotoGP World Championship for the RNF MotoGP Team. He rose through the ranks from the satellite team KTM Tech3, where he won the team’s first and second races, as well as his own.</p><p>He finished second in the 2018 Moto2 World Championship. He raced in Moto3 for the Mahindra Racing team in 2013 and 2014, the Estrella Galicia 0,0 team in 2012, and the Red Bull KTM Ajo team in 2015. Oliveira won the 2015 Italian Grand Prix for motorbikes, becoming the first Portuguese rider to win a World Championship.&nbsp;In 2009, he finished third in the Spanish championship, and in 2010, he contended for the title against Maverick Viales, barely losing by two points. He went on to become the first full-time Portuguese rider to participate in the world championships. He has won races in all three levels since then. Let’s get started with the post to discover more about Miguel Oliveira’s accident and other data about him.</p><h2>Miguel Oliveira Accident: Injury And Health Status Update</h2><p>Details on the<strong> Miguel Oliveira</strong> accident.<strong> Miguel Oliveira</strong>, whose team RNF Racing stated that he has been ruled out of the Argentine Grand Prix due to injuries suffered in a collision with Marc Marquez in the season-opening race in Portugal, will become the fourth rider to miss a MotoGP event this season.&nbsp;On Sunday’s Portuguese Grand Prix, Oliveira was racing second when Marquez’s Honda stopped up, forcing him to collide head-on with the rider of RNF Racing and fall out of the race.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Miguel-Oliveira-1.jpg alt="Miguel Oliveira" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Oliveira was originally allowed to participate the following weekend after examinations indicated a right leg contusion. Nonetheless, his club subsequently declared that he would be unable to compete in Argentina’s second round. Pol Espargaro of GasGas Factory Racing Tech3 was unable to compete in the weekend’s races due to a horrific incident in practice.&nbsp;Enea Bastianini of Ducati was taken to the hospital after fracturing his right scapula in an accident during the race on Saturday.</p><p>Marquez, who apologized for the error, will also miss the second round due to a broken hand, and his punishment will now be carried over to the next tournament in which he participates. The double long lap penalty will be paid in the next MotoGP event, in which Marc Marquez will be allowed to participate due to his injury and absence from the Argentina Grand Prix, according to MotoGP.</p><h2>Oliveira’s Personal Life Details</h2><p>Oliveira is studying dentistry while participating in the Grand Prix series. Miguel Oliveira founded the Oliveira Cup, a groundbreaking educational program in Portugal, in 2017.&nbsp;This Motorcycle School Trophy, along with his mentorship, is aimed at youths aged 10 to 14, with the goal of identifying his “successor.” Twelve young cyclists were enrolled for the first year.&nbsp;In September 2020, Oliveira announced his engagement to Andreia Pimenta, his stepmother’s daughter.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Miguel-Oliveira-2.jpg alt="Miguel Oliveira" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Oliveira and Andreia Pimenta made their first child’s imminent birth public in 2021.
