We see more diversity in casting and characters with each passing project.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Marvel and DC, the two biggest comic books and superhero franchises, are at the forefront of this development. And Marvel, more so than DC, has to take the lead on this one because it has the bigger character universe.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>In comics, Marvel has good diversity in representation. However, in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, that source material is yet to translate into something impressive. And that is especially the case for Hispanic characters. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>That being said, progress is being made, slowly but surely. And there are a few superhero characters that are already making their marks in the MCU.</p><p>So, here is a list of the Hispanic Marvel Characters that have made their way into the Marvel movies, whether that be in the MCU or the extended universe, ranked according to their strength.</p><h3>4. Angel Salvadore</h3><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Angel Salvadore lands the fifth spot on our VERY SPECIFIC list of strong <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Hispanic Marvel characters</a>. They featured her&nbsp;in X-Men: First Class and X-Men: Days of Future Past. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Salvadore, who worked as a stripper before she was recruited by Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr in the movies, had unique abilities like an insect. She (played by <a href=# rel=follow>Zoe Kravitz</a>) could fly, courtesy of her insect wings, which she hid by making them appear as if they were tattoos on her back and shoulders. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In addition to this, she could also use&nbsp;her acid saliva to attack enemies. She launched this corrosive substance from her mouth quickly,&nbsp;and they were strong enough to corrode materials.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h3>3. Sunspot</h3><p>Sunspot, or&nbsp;Roberto da Costa, is a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Brazillian character</a> in the X-Men universe who has <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Afro-Latino origins</a>. He has been featured in X-Men: Days of Future Past and The New Mutants. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In The New Mutants, Sunspot (played by Henry Zaga) was sent to the Milbury Hospital after accidentally killing his girlfriend, Mariella. He manifested his heat-related powers and burned her to death.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Henry Zaga, the Brazilian actor playing Sunspot in the New Mutants film (a casting choice which some people are calling whitewashing), is the son of the General Secretary for Bolsonaro’s party Alliance for Brazil, Admar Gonzaga. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pic.twitter.com/SinjGjq2aA</a> — Imprison the Dutch farmers at the Hague (@Hezbolsonaro) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">August 28, 2020</a></p><p>Sunspot has powers of solar energy absorption and solar re-channeling. These give him the ability to take a solar form, enhanced strength and durability, thermokinesis, and fire and heat immunity.</p><p>He can throw flames and use his combat skills to defeat opponents. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h3>2. Miles Morales</h3><p>Now we arrive at Miles Morales, or Spider-Man, who has become many's favorite version&nbsp;of the web-throwing superhero since the release of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse in 2018. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Morales, in the movie, is a teenager of African-American and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Puerto-Rican descent</a> who can speak both Spanish and English fluently. He was bitten by a radioactive spider, thus granting him spider-like abilities.</p><p>Due to the&nbsp;bite, he acquired many abilities, like spider physiology — superhuman strength, speed, agility, durability, and wall-crawling. He also got spider-sense, spider camouflage, and venom strike, which is his ability to shock his enemies with an electrical jolt through his hands.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>It has to be noted that his web-shooting abilities are courtesy of web-shooters his aunt May designed for him.</p><h3>1. America Chavez</h3><p><a href=# rel=follow>America Chavez</a> is the latest Hispanic character to be introduced in the MCU and the most powerful of the Hispanic superheroes. She is also the only character in this list to be&nbsp;from the actual MCU and not just having originated under the Marvel name as of this writing.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Chavez (played by <a href=# rel=follow>Xochitl Gomez</a>)&nbsp;first <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">appeared alongside</a> Doctor Strange and The Scarlet Witch in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and immediately became the Scarlet Witch's target due to her powers. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Wanda Maximoff described Chavez as a "supernatural being," which means she has abilities beyond a normal human or even a normal superhero. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>A drawing of the latest of the Hispanic Marvel Characters in the MCU, America Chaves.</strong> (Photo: No Artist Here/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Chaves has extra-dimensional energy physiology —&nbsp;she can manipulate extra-dimensional energy&nbsp;and has superhuman strength and durability. She can also open portals to alternate universes and can do dimensional travel without puking.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>However, the thing that really sets her apart is her uniqueness. She is one of one in the entire multiverse, and her supernatural abilities cannot be absorbed.</p><p>She could even become one of the <a href=# rel=follow>strongest female characters in the MCU</a> if she learns how to control her powers better. Whether she achieves that feat remains to be seen.</p><p><u><strong>Honorable mention</strong></u>: If having amazing humor and screen presence counted as a superpower, Luis <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">from the&nbsp;Ant-Man&nbsp;movies</a> would definitely make this list. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKCZqL2iusicZKaZoquyrXnCoZirmZOpsrO%2FjKuYp6OVmXupwMyl</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-montana-brown-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Montana Brown Dating Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./spongebob-squarepants.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>SpongeBob SquarePants Season 7 Episodes</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
