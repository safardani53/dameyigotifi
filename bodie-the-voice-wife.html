While we’re all impressed with freshman coach Camila Cabello’s finalist, Morgan Myles, one of <a href=#>Blake Shelton’s finalists, Bodie</a>, is who many people are rooting for. He won us over with his rendition of “You Found Me” by The Fray in the first round, and has since continued to impress.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>But he wouldn’t have made it this far without the support of his wife, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Royale Kuljian</a>, and their three kids. After Bodie’s finale performance of Brandon Lake’s “Gratitude,” he’s a definite frontrunner for <a href=#>The Voice crown</a>. But regardless of what happens, he’ll be going home to his wife and kids at the end of the day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.distractify.com/brand-img/dcwXjJZFT/200x200/headshot-1653400328516.jpg><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">‘The Voice’ star Bodie’s wife, Royale Kuljian, is also a creative spirit.</h2><p>Both Bodie and his wife, Royale Kuljian, are artists in some form. While we know <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bodie</a> for his incredible musical performances, he was a photographer and videographer before joining The Voice. He and his wife work together as wedding photographers with their business, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Together Creative</a>, although we doubt he’ll be doing much photography now that he’s 50,000 Instagram followers deep with a music career ahead of him.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram/@royalemoon</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Royale has stuck to her profession as a freelance photographer and videographer. Not only that, but she’s incredibly supportive of Bodie’s music career. She attended the auditions with him, and he even revealed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Parade</a> that when he’s writing music, “My wife writes with me a lot, and I work with one other producer sometimes. But it’s a pretty small group.”</p><p>Bodie has talked about Royale throughout his time on The Voice, and that coupled with their combined social media presence proves that they really are couple goals. On June 15, 2022, he honored Royale in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an Instagram post</a> for their seventh anniversary, which means they got married in 2015, when they were just 22-years-old. “7 YEARS,” he wrote.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram/@bodie</span></figure><p>“7 years married to the greatest human i’ve ever known. I honor you for the wise, intelligent, passionate, humble, patient, caring, steadfast, talented, hilarious, beautiful woman that you are. This has been the best 7 years of my life. You are a blessing to everyone that knows you. I can’t believe we get to do this for a lifetime.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Together, Bodie and Royale have three kids, who could be just as creative.</h2><p>Anyone who follows Bodie on Instagram knows that while he may have an alternative appearance, he’s a family man at his core. His wife and three kids are his “real top 5” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to him</a>. Their oldest son, Indie Wade Kuljian was born on June 6, 2017 and is now five-years-old. Bodie shared that Indie was a little too excited when he made it onto The Voice.</p><p>“He was with me on my Blind Audition day and he was just so excited,” Bodie told Parade. “He wasn’t allowed to tell anyone who I chose and, of course, he was telling everyone in our church. I’m like, ‘You gotta stop telling everybody.’ But he was telling everyone he’s famous now. He just says, ‘My dad’s famous,’ or he says that he’s famous. And then he’s signed a couple autographs, so it’s definitely gone to his head a little bit.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Then there’s Bodie’s younger children, Violet Roe, who was born in November 2018 and is now four-years-old, and Goldie Love, who was born in July 2020 and is just two-years-old. The family is truly one of the cutest celeb families we’ve ever seen, between their matching Halloween costumes from <a href=#>Shark Boy and Lava Girl</a>, and their matching outfits in photos. And the younger kids are just as excited about their dad being on television.</p><p>“My wife will send me videos of them watching the episode,” Bodie said. “They love seeing me sing and they love seeing little pictures or videos of B-roll of them on the TV, too. They’re so excited… It’s been so fun to show them what it looks like to chase the passion and dream.” Now, they can see that chasing that dream is really worth it.</p><p>The Voice finale airs tonight at 8 p.m. EST on NBC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7yltcRmq6GdXau8qq%2FEZq6inpU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./katt-williams.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Katt Williams Celebrity Profile Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-lurie-poston-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Lurie Poston Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
