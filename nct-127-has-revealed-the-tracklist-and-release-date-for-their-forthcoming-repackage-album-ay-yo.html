With the publication of the album‚Äôs first concrete material, including the tracklist and timetable, fans have gone to work, hunting for hints and clues that pertain to Ay‚Äôs idea. The first revelation, To Us, has sparked the greatest interest among fans, owing to its obscurity. NCTzens (NCT‚Äôs fanbase) have linked the dots and believe that To Us is related to their earlier To You release.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>ballin big time and i say ayyo? punch tease? <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/H7Zr9siwtk</a></p><p>‚Äî #FREEJOY üî™ (@96_aegi) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">January 5, 2023</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>IT‚ÄôS OFFICIALLY 127 SEASON AGAIN <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#NCT127_Ay_Yo</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/cznT20hwpC</a></p><p>‚Äî heebs ‚ö°Ô∏è AY-YO (@moonhbss) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">January 5, 2023</a></p><p>To You was a concept in which each NCT member went down to record a message for another member at the start of their new album, Punch. The video was an emotional roller coaster for both members and viewers, as each of them spoke out about their feelings for one another and expressed their support for the impending album projects. Fans anticipate more touching material in the next To Us, which they feel will be of a similar nature.&nbsp;Furthermore, the photographs depicting the tracklist image have gotten fans talking as they continue to speculate on the topic, genre, and idea that the repackaged album would use. Fans believe the album will have a cool summer vibe with a beachy and refreshing theme based on the group photograph connected to the tracklist.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/NCT-127-2.jpg alt="NCT 127" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Furthermore, as is customary for album releases, NCT 127 has altered its profile images on Instagram and Twitter to reflect the album‚Äôs design, and fans are completely smitten with the idea.
