She was born into a family of Hollywood royalties and grew up loving the craft. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, thinking she had an easy way into stardom would be going a bit too far. She made her own way into her current fame, even if she obviously has acting genes in her. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Dakota Johnson's Family Tree Is All Showbiz</h2><p>Dakota was born&nbsp;on October 4, 1989, in Austin, Texas, to actor parents Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith. She is their only child, and they separated in 1996.</p><p>While Don did not have an acting heritage (his father was a farmer and his mother a beautician), Dakota's maternal grandparents were Hollywood royalties. Griffith's parents were <a href=# rel=follow>Tippi Hedren</a> and Peter Griffith.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Tippi (full name:&nbsp;Nathalie Kay Hedren)&nbsp;is a successful former fashion model and actress, having worked in movies with the great Alfred Hitchcock and appeared on the covers of Glamour and Life magazines. She has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and has even been awarded the Jules Verne Award. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Peter, too, had done acting on Broadway as a child but later&nbsp;moved to advertising. He worked as an advertising executive before his death in 2001.</p><p>While Melanie was the only child Peter had with Tippi, he had two more children with his second wife, Nanita Greene — daughter Tracy Griffith and son Clay A. Griffith. Tracy, too, became an actress, whereas Clay went into set design.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Melanie began acting when she was just a child and appeared in a Hitchcock movie her mother was in. She had her first major acting job at 17 on Arthur Penn's Night Moves and also appeared alongside her mother in 1981's Roar. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Dakota does not have any biological siblings, but she has six step-siblings.</p><p>On her mother Melanie's side, she has two — half-brother Alexander Griffith Bauer (born on August 22, 1985) and half-sister Stella del Carmen Banderas (born on September 24, 1986).</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>On her father Don's side, she has four step-siblings — half-brothers Jesse Wayne (born on December 7, 1982), Jasper (born on June 6, 2002), Deacon Johnson (born on April 29, 2006), and half-sister Atherton Grace Johnson (born on December 28, 1999). <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Many of her step-siblings, including Stella, Grace, and Jesse, are already making a name for themselves in Hollywood. Jesse is a producer and musician with a bit of acting experience, Stella is a model signed with IMG Models, and Grace is a model, entrepreneur, and actress.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Dakota Johnson's Parents Didn't Want Her to Pursue Acting</h2><p>If anyone was in a place to launch her acting career by using family leverage, it was Dakota. The actress practically grew up on sets and watching legendary actors be brilliant at their jobs.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>But Don and Melanie weren't keen on their daughter pursuing a career in Hollywood early in her life. They wanted Dakota to, as she&nbsp;put in during her interview with <a href=# rel="follow noopener">W Magazine</a> in January 2022, "have as much of a childhood as I could." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Dakota, however, "couldn't wait" to become an actress. She even had a bit of back and forth with her father regarding the same.</p><p>After high school, Don wanted her to go to college. Dakota, however, didn't want to. But he was going to provide her with no financial support if she didn't attend college — a deal he made with all his five children.</p><p></p><p><strong>Dakota Johnson with her parents, father, Don Johnson, and mother, Melanie Griffith.</strong> (Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>She hesitantly applied to Juilliard School but got rejected. She still worked instead of attending an acting school.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>During an interview with SiriusXM's&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Stars</a>, she recalled "having, like, $47" in her bank account and not being able to buy groceries. It was the life she chose, and she didn't regret it.</p><p>Just months after getting off her father's payroll, she landed her small role in 2010's The Social Network. Since then, her roles have gotten steadily bigger, and the same has happened to her stature. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJyRoLy1rYyjpqGmo6S7brzAq5ynrKNiwKquy6KloKtencGuuA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./raven-gates-did-nick-viall-make-her-you-know.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Did Nick Viall Make Her ...
