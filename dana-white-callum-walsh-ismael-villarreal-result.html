So yeah, definitely happy with that; real happy."</p><p>Despite fighting on enemy territory, Cork clubber Walsh came out to a deafening rendition of the world-known chant of the travelling Irish.</p><p>"Ole, Ole, Ole" rang throughout the arena before the super-prospect made his way to the ring.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Boxing</h2></p><p>And a clearly frustrated Villarreal, who had plenty of his loved ones in the crowd, looked to silence the hostile crowd early with a stiff and piston-like jab.</p><p>Slick southpaw Walsh, however, did a good job of cutting off the ring early and putting the American on the back foot.</p><p>Walsh looked to land to the body early doors and had success with rasping hooks.</p><p>Villarreal soon got the respect of Walsh with a beautiful overhand right counter before the halfway point of the round.</p><p>Another right soon rattled the dome of Walsh, who responded with a good straight left.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/11/0d45d220-4a52-4eca-bb71-f684f56fb4c5.jpg><p>Walsh started the second like a bat out of hell and sent the sweat flying off Villarreal's glistening forehead with a straight left which drew a big reaction from the crowd.</p><p>Walsh invested heavily in the lead uppercut soon after but Villarreal was wise to them.</p><p>One, however, found its way through the guard and briefly wobbled the local lad, who was forced to cover up and block an ensuing flurry.</p><p>Walsh looked to work behind his jab early in the third as he tried to pen Villarreal into the corner.</p><p><span id=761809cf-2e93-46ba-9101-f8cc3147088c class=suggested-link>The Irishman</span> landed a good lead hook in tight a minute into the stanza but failed to follow up with anything of note.</p><p>Villarreal's corner erupted when their man landed two hard shots and started stalking a retreating and tiring visitor.</p><p>And he almost had him on his backside seconds before the end of the round courtesy of a swift three-piece combo.</p><p>Villarreal thought he'd scored a big knockdown early in the fourth but the ref judged him to have pushed down his man.</p><p>Walsh looked tired midway through the round but came back with a rip-roaring combo - which included a nasty uppercut - that put Villarreal on wobbly legs.</p><p>But instead of rushing in for the kill, the southpaw opted to pick his shots before being hurt by a low below seconds before the bell.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-10-at-00.45.01.png><p>Villarreal headhunted for most of the fifth, abandoning the feints and footwork which served him well in the third.</p><p>Walsh blocked most of the telegraphed shots which came his way and actually egged on his foe to throw more.</p><p>A clash of heads briefly paused the action after the start of the sixth but Walsh shook off the cobwebs and quickly went back to work.</p><p>Two successive three-punch combos in a row snapped back the head of Villarreal, who made sure to respond with one of his own after being cracked.</p><p>Walsh then struggled to land his straight left on the feint and taunt-heavy Villarreal, who went hell for leather after hearing the 10-second clacker.</p><p>He got the better of the two ensuing exchanges and went back to his corner full of confidence for the seventh.</p><p>The Irish in attendance were worried for their man in the eighth when he went into retreat mode and stopped working behind the jab.</p><p>But the shot of the round came from the fatigued prospect, who opened up a cut above the brow of Villarreal with a brilliant right hook.</p><p>A clearly tired Walsh clinched multiple times after the restart, much to the frustration of Villarreal's team.</p><p>Walsh planted a beauty of a straight left on the dome of Villarreal in the final minute of the stanza, although the American took it like a champ.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-10-at-00.35.51-1.png><p>Neither man showed any great sense of urgency early in the ninth, despite it seemingly being a razor-close fight.</p><p>Walsh edged himself ahead with a beauty of a straight left that appeared to stagger Villarreal.</p><p>However, it did the exact opposite, stirring his foe on and prompting him to hunt for hard shots to the body.</p><p>A stiff one-two briefly set Villarreal back in his tracks but he quickly composed himself and went again.</p><p>As they were in the early embers of the ninth, both men were patient and opted not to rush in recklessly in the final round.</p><p>Walsh, however, found himself in trouble after being knocked down by a series of hooks with two minutes of the round remaining</p><p>He quickly bounced back to his feet but, surprisingly, went on the retreat.</p><p>Walsh was on course to finish the round strong until he had the sweat smacked off his forehead by a huge overhand right.</p><p>Fan in attendance were left stunned by the wide scorecards, with many expecting a split decision verdict to be announced.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Hollywood Fight Night results</h2><p>Callum Walsh def.
