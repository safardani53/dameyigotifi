He was best known for establishing the Schweitzer Hospital, which provided exceptional medical care to the people of Lambaréné, Gabon.</p><p>Albert Schweitzer was born on <strong>January 14, 1875,</strong> in Kaysersberg, Alsace, France, the son of an Evangelical Lutheran minister. Albert grew up in a comfortable and happy environment. When he was about eight years old, he had an experience that shaped his life. He reluctantly aimed his slingshot at several birds at the strong urging of another lad, which, as he later wrote, “sang sweetly into the morning sunshine,” he was moved, and he “made a silent vow to miss.” At that moment, the sound of church bells blended with the sunshine and bird song… It sounded like a voice from heaven to me. I tossed my slingshot aside, shooed the birds away to protect them from my friend’s slingshot, and ran home.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Albert-Schweitzer-iii.jpg><h2>21 Quotes of Albert Schweitzer</h2><p>“At times our own light goes out and is rekindled by a spark from another person.

But if he does that each day he can sleep at night and do it again the next day. “-&nbsp; <strong>Albert Schweitzer</strong></p><p>” Compassion, in which all ethics must take root, can only attain its full breadth and depth if it embraces all living creatures and does not limit itself to mankind. “-&nbsp; <strong>Albert Schweitzer</strong></p><p>” Anyone who proposes to do good must not expect people to roll stones out of his way but must accept his lot calmly, even if they roll a few stones upon it. “-&nbsp; <strong>Albert Schweitzer</strong></p><p>” As soon as man does not take his existence for granted, but beholds it as something unfathomably mysterious, thought begins. “-&nbsp; <strong>Albert Schweitzer</strong></p><p>” Everything deep is also simple and can be reproduced simply as long as its reference to the whole truth is maintained. But what matters is not what is witty but what is true. “-&nbsp; <strong>Albert Schweitzer</strong></p><p>” A great secret of success is to go through life as a man who never gets used up. “-&nbsp; <strong>Albert Schweitzer</strong></p><p>” I have always held firmly to the thought that each one of us can do a little to bring some portion of misery to an end. “-&nbsp; <strong>Albert Schweitzer</strong></p><p>” Impart as much as you can of your spiritual being to those who are on the road with you, and accept as something precious what comes back to you from them. “-&nbsp; <strong>Albert Schweitzer</strong></p><p>” Serious illness doesn’t bother me for long because I am too inhospitable a host. “-&nbsp; <strong>Albert Schweitzer</strong></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Albert Schweitzer bio</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Albert Schweitzer quotes</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYpZqVp8Fuv8Khrp6hpK%2Bys3nQrqatnaNk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-devin-ratray-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Devin Ratray Dating Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jake-paul-tommy-fury-weigh-in-live-stream-free-watch-online.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jake Paul vs Tommy Fury weigh in LIVE: Paul tips the scales at 183lbs while Fury's result reads one</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-graham-x-prettylittlething-spring-2019-campaign-pics.html>Ashley Graham x PrettyLittleThing Spring 2019 Campaign: Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-murphy-jillian-bell-candy-cane-lane-first-trailer-7972444.html>Eddie Murphy Stars in First Trailer for 'Candy Cane Lane'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jimmy-barnes.html>Jimmy Barnes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./massachusetts-dog-abandoned-on-hot-day-rescued.html>Massachusetts Pomeranian Abandoned in Crate on Hot Day Is Rescued</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-gere-young-photos.html>Photos From Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe.
